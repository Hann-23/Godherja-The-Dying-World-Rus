Descended from colonists sent primarily from Kalathipsomi due to their experience with rugged northern terrain, the Apokiakas adopted many of their qualities, preferring more mundane and practical things to decadent displays. They often went even further, northerners becoming known for mixing Aversarian garb with tribal wear, worshipping a mix of Aversarian and native gods, and even marrying into tribal dynasties in order to secure alliances and their borders.\n\nA hardy and proud people, they were nonetheless nearly entirely destroyed in [frodbrokna|E] and the [fog|E], what few survivors there were interspersing as refugees in the south, swearing fealty to Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' and the Sjalvolki or being led west by Nicanoneus, the Black Sun.#" #NT!

They are moreover known for prizing communal bonds, aiding one another when in need. They are inclined towards establishing enclaves in settlements that lie on upon their trade routes, developing thriving communities in far off lands.

Rejected and scapegoated by their new neighbors, they were frequently victimized further with massacres and exile during the many [lich|E] invasions of the Marches. This would last until the reign of High Queen Arelli, who would grant the Oejeynicans a Grand Duke to represent them and a homeland in return for them protecting part of the northern border in her name. Since then, they have earned the dubious honor of being the first to kneel at the coronation of each new High King, which is both a mark of prestige and submission. They have begun to assimilate to Chevalien culture, though still retain many distinctive traditions and customs.\n\nThe cultural practices of the Oejeynica are born of a fusion between Ojyczaynz and Chevalien, from their unique dialect that blends the languages, to various everyday activities. With the Liches on their border, they have learned to cherish life, as they are commonly the first victims of any assault.

At the start the slaves were worked to death, brutalised, used in rituals by the practitioners, but they were far away from the readily available slaves the rest of the Empire had access to. As decadence soon took hold of the Magi, the chains on their slaves began to loosen. Over time the slaves were allowed more autonomy, able to have their own families (of course, born into servitude) and splitting cultures started to develop within the insular slaves.

This prosperity was ironically born from their homeland's poor fertility and mountainous terrain causing them to trade in order to sustain their population. The driving necessity to keep the wealth flowing taught the Adrakamp chieftains the subtle art of diplomacy to avoid the more bloody aspects of Sjalvolki clan politics. Instead of fighting for territory, the Adrakamp were called to mediate disputes between rival tribes, and Adrakamp towns were neutral ground for the purposes of commerce and diplomacy, with blood feuds and vendettas becoming legally null the moment a clansman crossed into their territory.

The leader of those who accepted this oath was named Irmi, and so would his tribe be called the People of Irmi, or Irmionoth.\n\nSeeking to uphold this contract, they began training, becoming ever more skilled at the arts of war. When the tribe was wronged, they would descend upon their enemy with a fury unmatched, and avenge every perceived slight. Internally, they held to a simple code, that everything must be proportional. If one were to be caught thieving, they would be required to return something of equal value in addition to the stolen goods.

Strangely, sparse records from decades ago have made no note of any unique languages, simply noting them as Amaghean shepherds.\n\nAs a result, most of Amaghea regards them as a simple and backwater people who spout nonsense words to each other. However, the Yylaxxaz are a philosophically minded people, with tribal elders often meeting to discuss the path that the world has taken, smoking chort and talking long into the night.#" #NT!

The Adani have thus always relied upon scholar-kings to lead them through the cold and dry winters when magic has been the only solution to famine and drought. Such reliance upon the most learned has solidified the place of ancient and tested knowledge amongst the Adani, and a xenophobic attitude to their neighbours who they believe wish to rob them of their sacred secrets, especially following the [dharya_varha|E].\n\nThe most peculiar tradition of the Adani to foreign observers is often remarked to be the Doynateka Saryatti, 'the Race of Two Hills', whereby elephants are chased down hilltops with icons of the god Sarvat upon their backs; those who sponsor the elephant that reaches the bottom first are said to be saved from drought for ten cycles of [aervalr|E].

Instead of agricultural cities, the Karkit build small homesteads with lush gardens around them as a perimeter. One in every seven boys is chosen to train as Garden Warden, trained both martially and horticulturally. This guardian protects the humble gardening communities from their less passive neighbours, although a lone protector has historically not fared well against anything more threatening than lost bandits.\n\nA Karkit homestead usually consists of a single clan formed of seventeen families, between which childcare and medical assistance is a shared duty. Slow to trust but possessive of those they love, Karkit culture is built around a shared struggle in a land that is not their own.

Now, after centuries of learning their craft, the Zabari are unafraid of expanding their new cities at all costs.\n\nZabari cities are also famous for their diverse array of weaponry, with every style of sword or club imaginable, as well as various projectile weapons, sold in their vast markets.

Whilst these cities would eventually grow into trade hubs, they were born as havens of coercion; old tales speak of Sarutan pirates preying on those who avoided their ports.\n\nThe Sarutan right to rule is historically determined by who holds the ancient Phulikam of their city, though many noble families have long since consolidated their right to pass it to their sons and daughters to maintain dynastic control.

Despite their customs, however, no creature of their titanic forests is known to spare them tooth or claw.\n\nThe houses of the Lainar are filled with people of all classes, as it is their custom to feed all who come to their table hungry. It is seen as a disgrace not to entertain a weary traveller or sing to those displaced by storms, and so the Lainar often train themselves in the arts of dancing and the playing of the Bansuri flute to ensure that none leave their halls without a smile on their face.

Each clan typically owns a ship for every ten members; no man or woman is fit for marriage or a holding without seizing the cargo of twenty vessels due to their strict clan hierarchies. Battles between the Deraani are common, but are usually solved as quickly as they start with large gatherings between captains known as Tyanan Rudu, where feasting and duelling dominate the long nights.\n\nThe Deraani funerary ritual for a captain is well-documented, and consists of them, and any amongst their crew willing to pass on with them, being tied to the mast of their ship and sent to drift away across the Pirate Coast.
