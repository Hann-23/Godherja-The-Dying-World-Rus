 bm_1217_the_black_gold_league_desc: "With the mysterious death of Dendon den va Seignon, Chevalie prepares for civil war. While Dendon's father was the deaded Cristofff and the first High King to unite the Marchers in a generation, Dendon was always considered weak, too kind to stomp out the machinations of the unruly nobles and too afeared of the Liches to stop their increasingly brazen raids.\n\nIn opposition to his young and unexperienced son Gardfrei, the proud Valadecs and the ancient Monteaux have joined together in the Black-Gold League, pushing Gardfrei's cousin and childhood friend Teryn Valadec as their pretender to the throne despite accusations of their assassination of Dendon.\n\nWill the headstrong Gardfrei cement the Den va Seignon legacy and reunite the throne? Or will the Valadec's finally take the throne they've coveted for so many generations?" #NT!
