 bm_the_empire_of_ash_1200_desc: "Naught remains of Aversaria besides the ashes of its wonders and the bones of her children. The race of the pure, the true exemplars of humanity, the shining beacon of the Purest's grace in the sea of non-human barbarians... is gone, destroyed by its greatest exemplars.\n\nAautokratir Aeschraes fights to control his lands, claiming the devastation of Self Replicating Blood Magic and Frodbrokna are naught but proof that he still holds the right to rule Aversaria's corpse. Across the sea, Sarradon burns alongside Aversaria, and the north crumbles as the people of Katraddia race to escape what more and more name the Fog..." #NT!
