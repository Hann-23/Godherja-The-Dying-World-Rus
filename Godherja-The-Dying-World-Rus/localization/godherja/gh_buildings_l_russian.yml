Ordinary foodstuffs have become so cheap that it is no longer profitable to merely sell them directly on their own. Rather, it seems that every single stall in this massive, district-spanning market has some local twist to old dishes and completely unique ones of their own.\n\nThough poverty is a problem as in any other place, at the very least, even the most wretched commoner can likely afford a dinner that would be fit for the banquet of a noble in some less prosperous place." #NT!

Umloj had become, through strange twists of fate, host to a community of two dozen different religious sects and over thirty cults, and the rebellion was quickly joined by many of them in protest to what was seen as repressive attempts at conversion by the authorities.\n\nPeace was signed soon after, and Umloj declared a free city for all religions (as long as they paid proper tax, of course). Since then, the 'Umloj Covenant' has become one of the most diverse areas in the world, boasting a number of temples, chapels, and cathedrals that threatens to surpass the number of houses in the city. Religions as common as Wardenism to as obscure as the Graveright of Oejeynica can be found here in relative peace, and the mass diversity has proven to be a great boon to trade." #NT!

Despite the beauty and the history, however, the palace has fallen to disrepair. With Opakhasia united anew, the palace has been renewed and rebuilt. Just as lavish as ever, it is now a shining symbol of not just Aversaria, but its resilience." #NT!

While initially thought to have been built by a strange cult or spirits, [aversarian|E] archaeologists would later date the site through fossil and spiritual study to roughly 699 BE.\n\nIt is unknown where the shrine has come from, but Aversarian attempts to cross the lava field proved fruitless. Any attempted bridge projects failed spectacularly, through constant accidents from the slave workforce or [magical|E] back-casting. By all accounts, the site seems cursed, any attempt to reach it doomed to failure from bad luck more than seemingly any magic in the site itself.\n\nCenware 'Witch-Breaker' and his refugee army would rediscover the site over a hundred years since it had passed from Aversarian interest while journeying west.

Corpulent, greedy and exceptionally hedonistic, Kresox's bitter refusal to show even the basic traits of leadership led to his constant damaging of the war effort and the failure of any organized response to the invasion.\n\nWhen Kresox came to the ancient shrine in this spot to meet with the Witch-Breaker, he had his personal guard turn on his lieutenants and had them brought to Cenware in chains. Kresox offered his generals as slaves, along with the armies, in return for the right to keep his slaves.\n\nThe Witch-Breaker agreed to the offer, and Kresox signed an official declaration ordering the Legions of Kalathipsomi (II 'Proudest', IX 'Purety', VII 'Valor' and XVII 'Pathos') to surrender themselves to the Witch-Breaker immediately. Once the agreement was signed, Cenware ordered Kresox's slaves brought forth so that they may be returned to the Legon, and then had Kresox stripped and thrown to the mass, informing the slaves that the Legon had been returned to them as requested to do as they wished. As Kresox was beaten to death, the Witch-Breaker informed the surrendered legionary's that he formally freed them from their slavery, and ordered them to return to their homes and learn crafts other than war.

Suddenly, instead of any other normal tree falling down, this tree's bark turned almost inky black and became resistant to any attempts to cut it down. After a concerted effort on the part of the loggers, a small wound was opened which revealed sap with a rich deep green colour. Upon touching the sap, the man's hands developed a prickling sensation and a feeling of dread overcame him. Worried about this new development, the men sought help and assistance back in the Aversarian homelands and the news slowly spread into the ears of the rich and powerful.

After a disastrous series of battles for both sides, the Legions retreated... and did so into the center of the Sjalvolki horde.\n\nThe following Battle of the Ten Trees would last for nearly six months, as the Sjalvolki and Imperials brutally fought through the worst winter in Kalathipsomian memory, more soldiers freezing or starving to death than dying in any battle. By the end the Sjalvolki would come out victorious, however, and the shattered remnants of the Legions would disband, join the last remnants of Imperial control under the treacherous Legon Kresox, or retreat south to be wiped out at the Elysian Pass.\n\nWhile overshadowed by the battle of the Pass, most scholars agree that the Ten Trees was the last time the Aversarian Legions posed any threat to Cenware's horde, and veterans of the battle often speak bitterly of the 'glory' of the Pass and the forgotten misery of the Ten Trees.

Built during the reign of an Aautokratir that clearly valued practicality over any kind of aesthetics whatsoever, the gate is often described as an impregnable, blocky monstrosity that is at once both the strongest bulwark and biggest eyesore of the city's entire defense system.\n\nFinally, the Vilnian Gate is most notable for being the most busy thoroughfare of the entire city.

Only in the form of tattered banners and the scattered surviving pages of burned books can the memory of when this place was the end of a great trade network be found." #NT!

Clad in the uniforms of countless Legions, the Aversarians slain at the Elysian Pass still relive that doomed battle, screaming in a deafening cacophony. What causes their spirits to cry in such apparent pain is unknown, perhaps incomprehensible. But, so long as explorers still dare venture into their section of the Foglands, their struggle will not be forgotten." #NT!

The land filled with the corpses of [aversaria|E]'s last armies is, under the control of one of its undead conquerors, a mighty source of power indeed. Once more do the Legions of Aversaria march, under the banners of great [magi|E]. Were one to ignore their skeletal forms, it would almost resemble the empire of old." #NT!
