 fp1_yearly.0031.desc.wrestled_fogbeast: ""... knew that I either had to abandon my men, or fight the [fogbeast|E] myself. Grabbed my knife, lunged at the thing, and wrestled it into submission with one hand!"" #NT!
 fp1_yearly.0031.desc.charged_city: ""... charged right up to the city walls, free-climbed inside, and hacked my way into the royal palace. Melted the king's crown down to pay for a new pair of boots."" #NT!
 fp1_yearly.0031.desc.slew_lich: ""... and there I am, bloody [lich|E] staring right at me with its green eyes - that is, until I hacked its skull off with my sword and took the thing home as a mantelpiece!"" #NT!
 fp1_yearly.0031.desc.wooed_heir: ""... [disparaged_king.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [invented_heir.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], now #EMP that#! is the best I've ever had. [disparaged_king.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] wasn't such a fan of me after that, though, and I fled [disparaged_king.GetHerHis] court sharpish, I'll tell you that!"" #NT!
 fp1_yearly.0031.desc.hunted_troll: ""... 'course, this most recent wound is from the troll itself. Big as a house, quiet as a mouse, claws like the bastard spawn of [lying_warrior.GetFaith.DevilName]. Still, stab anything long enough, and it dies."" #NT!
  
  # #Flavour Events 
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.amsari: "a people in the far west, their civilization nestled on the banks of a great river cutting through an otherwise barren desert, who are ruled by a powerful prophet." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.ayyar: "an adventurous people hailing from a rich kingdom in eastern Sarradon, who traveled from distant lands to find a home for themselves. [norse_explorer.GetSheHe] tells us that their wars and heroism are the stuff of legends, and that any man with the right ambition can become rich as a king in their great dominion, no matter his station of birth nor the gods he worships." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.red_waste: "an evil desert in the south, red as blood, inhabited by queer peoples who fear the Sun and are ruled by power-hungry [aversarian|E] [magi|E] and Kikarsagi horse-lords. If one can get past the dark cults that skulk the waste's rifts, however, there is much ancient plunder to be recovered, and [norse_explorer.GetFirstName] even shows off a few baubbles of strange make allegedly recovered from these ruins." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.corsairs_coast: "the treacherous watery gate to the Far East, where [the_continent|E] and [sarradon|E] meet, and corsairs without number rule. [norse_explorer.GetFirstName] claims that [norse_explorer.GetHerHis] fleet was attacked by pirates no less than four times as [norse_explorer.GetSheHe] was passing through the area, but also points out that it was not the sea-dogs [norse_explorer.GetSheHe] feared, but the krakens rumoured to stalk the waves below..." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.lichdoms: "the dreaded northern realms of the dead - the [lichdoms|E]. Largely sticking to the coast, [norse_explorer.GetSheHe] describes beaches quite literally made of bone, roving hordes of skeletal abominations, ominous spires black as pitch, and even a close run-in with a ghostly armada kept afloat by nothing but vile magicks." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.adabyss: "a land deep in [sarradon|E] ruled by a vast, powerful empire of conquerors and statue-worshippers. The arcane [magical|E] contraptions they make use of sound almost outrageously unbelievable and more fit for a childrens' tale, including ships that can sail the skies and pipes that rain fiery death upon their foes." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.lonely_light_fake: "a chain of islands lost to time, cut off from the rest of the world by the lands of the dead. The locals have apparently built a society far in advance of anything else on Aeras, are ruled by an immortal [magi|E] of godlike powers, and are generally uninterested in the affairs of the rest of the world. Somehow, this all sounds... dubious." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.kathun_kai_fake: "the mysterious lands of the far east, Kathun-Kai. The tales paint a glorious picture of an exotic Empire still in its prime, their sovereign having somehow stopped the [fog|E], and the locals apparently still so rich as to allow even peasants to live in castles made of gold. Somehow, this all sounds... dubious." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.voreia_real: "the mysterious lands of the far north, beyond even the [lichdoms|E]. This claim, naturally, draws visible disbelief, but [norse_explorer.GetFirstName] continues - [norse_explorer.GetSheHe] describes a still, beautiful land covered in ice, with nights that glow sickly greens and crimsons rather than being dark, icicle men, and a strange bird that was apparently as ferocious as a bear. When asked about landfall, however, [norse_explorer.GetSheHe] shakes [norse_explorer.GetHerHis] head and claims that there was "some kind of fell [magic|E]" blocking their access, but seems to struggle to explain its exact nature." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.voreia_fake: "the mysterious lands of the far north, beyond even the [lichdoms|E]. [norse_explorer.GetFirstName] talks of cities built entirely out of ice, inhabited by demons of snow that ride upon dragons. Somehow, this all sounds... dubious." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.lonely_light_real: "a chain of islands lost to time, cut off from the rest of the world by the lands of the dead. The locals were apparently so taken aback by travellers from beyond their shores that [norse_explorer.GetHerHis] party was attacked by tattoed warriors emerging from dark groves as soon as they tried to make landfall, forcing them to return." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.kathun_kai_real: "the mysterious lands of the far east, Kathun-Kai. The tales paint a bleak picture of an exotic realm in dire straits - in many places, the [fog|E] has reached the shores of the sea, and petty warlords each claim to be Emperor, fighting over the ashes of a radiant empire now in ruins." #NT!
 fp1_yearly.1081.desc.south_sarradon_real: "the mysterious lands of southern [sarradon|E] - not even the fabled Adabyssinians, in fact, but even more south than that. The tales are truly something to behold, with benevolent dead ruling the living from colossal pyramids, and commanding legions uncounted in their eternal war against their northern enemies." #NT!
