 game_concept_battle_of_the_wall_of_astila: "Battle of the Wall of Astila" #NT!
 game_concept_battle_of_the_wall_of_astila_desc: "The Battle of the Wall of Astila was the final battle in the [bayyuralar|E]. Taking place at what is now known as the Wall of Astila, Baytor rode to relieve the clan of Korsakai Khatan, who had forded across the river and engaged Astilik forces. Outmatched by the Astilik soldiers, Korsakai Khatan held out in hopes of Baytor's forces arriving to relieve him on time. As Baytor's forces forded a brook to get to Korsakai's clan, Baytor's horse lost its footing and threw him off. Though accounts differ, with Baytor's brother and bondsman Mogha writing that he dashed his head upon the rocks and floated off and the leader of the Khaiasheg, Ögotei Tankhatan, writing that he was weighed down by his armor and the masks of the warriors he defeated preventing him from swimming to safety, he drowned before his Khaiashegs could dismount and rescue him. Both his corpse and the sword of his grandfather, [iorne_seld|E], were lost to the river.\n\nAfter his death, his forces were thrown into disarray and many of the clans wanted to desert. However, both Ögotei and Mogha rallied them to rescue Korsakai's forces, and they forded the brook and conducted a pitched battle against the Astiliks, though they were thrown back across the river along with Korsakai and the remnants of his clan. Afterward, the Öltenic horde dispersed in the [aironoian_migration|E].\n\nThe battle proved to be the death-blow to the [otachedian_empire|E], which collapsed soon after. However, it also resulted in an influx of Öltenic cultures and religions in Aironoi, and the emergence of new empires over the next centuries. It is doubtful that Baytor, were he not to have drowned, could have won the battle. The Öltenis were outmatched in equipment, training, and in familiarity with their environs, and Baytor's refusal to augment his forces with Kashiryans resulted in them relying on Öltenic shamans for their [magi|E], who were outmatched by the animal-magi of the Astilik Empire." #NT!
 game_concept_aironoian_migration: "Aironoian Migration" #NT!
 game_concept_aironoian_migration_desc: "The Aironoian Migration was a resettling of Öltenic clansmen in Aironoi in the aftermath of the [battle_of_the_wall_of_astila|E]. After Kagakhatan Baytor's death, his army largely dispersed into warlord groups who displaced or assimilated native cultures in their territory. Foremost of these warlords was Korsakai Khatan, who had survived the battle though was rendered lame by an axe strike to his thigh.\n\nAlthough Korsakai Khatan's clan was mostly wiped out, his martial prowess and charisma allowed him to exert influence over the other warlords, and he proclaimed himself hayakhatan soon after. Other influential khatans in Baytor's army followed suit, though their empires crumbled after their deaths while Korsakai's empire lasted a generation after his own death.\n\nWhile most of the Öltenis that followed Baytor were content to remain in Aironoi and forge their own destiny, the remainder either went back into Kashirya with Ögotei and Mogha or migrated elsewhere. One of the peculiarites of the migration was the view that Baytor was a hero who died before his time; this view was spread by Korsakai, who respected Baytor greatly, while Ögotei and Mogha demonized him upon their return to Kashirya." #NT!
 game_concept_charchac_revolt: "Charchac Revolt" #NT!
 game_concept_svanti_revolt: "Svanti Revolt" #NT!
 game_concept_charchac_revolt_desc: "Having been exhausted by both the [aversarian_civil_war|E] and [frodbrokna|E], Amaghean slave plantations were devastated at the dawn of the 13th century. In the wake of this, the Charchac Revolt (sometimes referred to as the Svanti Revolt) arose to claim the lands of the Draneti and Charchac peoples. Whilst fought intermittently from 1200 until 1250 IS, with a relative lull following the fall of Ksagro in 1224, the bloodiest fighting took place from 1240 IS. Under the leadership of Krenverso seye nas Darashbal, the [fire_gate|E] was almost reclaimed by the revolt; the [fiery_chariots_night|E], however, shattered the revolt into a series of insignificant warlords almost immediately." #NT!
 game_concept_fiery_chariots_night: "Night of the Fiery Chariots" #NT!
 game_concept_fiery_chariots_night_desc: "The Night of the Fiery Chariots was the climax of the [svanti_revolt|E] in the second month of 1250 IS. Under the ruthless command of Krenverso Darashbal, the armies of Svanti marched to reclaim the [fire_gate|E]. As the most impressive Charchac [fire_magi|E] for centuries, Krenverso had been compared to the gods of Alau Sakmir beyond the Gate. Making the march to reclaim the pathway to the Gods' realm was the last step on his journey to end Amaghea's hold on his people's ancestral mountains.\n\nHowever, at the foot of Alau Koev, Krenverso met a [magi|E] far more experienced than he. Vahktan Vashvili, the vampire prince of Amaghea, led a disciplined army that numbered twice the size of the Svanti expedition. Within mere seconds of meeting, the mountain became a chaotic massacre interspersed with wild feats of [living_magic|E]. Neither side saw fit to admit defeat, even as Krenverso's flesh began to sear under the intense heat of his flames.\n\nThe battle was lost to the Charchacs when the right flank of Krenverso's horde was shattered by the charge of a third party, the 'White Lion' Akakih Kazvelli. Many Charchac survivors of the night claim that their cavalry looked like flaming chariots emerging form the realm of the gods, seeking to end the blasphemy of the mad king of Svanti. In the turmoil, Krenverso's lieutenants abandoned his cause, forcing him to flee east and abandon his goal.\n\nThe humiliation of the battle was the beginning of the end for the [charchac_revolt|E]. In a bid to reverse his loss of face, Krenverso brutally executed any amongst his lieutenants that he found in the following months. The sight of a skinless monster callously tearing apart those that once called him 'friend' was met with horror wherever he treaded. By the end of 1250 IS, Krenverso had lost all but the lands around Ksagro." #NT!

 game_concept_daharat_sun_desc: "The Opakhasian [magi|E] Dethiclas declared that he had found what seemed to have been a ritual that matched the stories of the [fire_gate|E], an ancient teleportation spell that he found through research with Vidvaookeyatran scholars. The theory was never able to be proven, however, with Dethiclas, the ritual and the Vidvaookeyatran scholars of the academy in Darahat (along with the academy itself, and the city and its surrounding countryside) being destroyed when they attempted to replicate the ritual and accidentally summoned a miniature sun in the city for two to three seconds." #NT!

 game_concept_fire_gate: "Fire Gate" #NT!
 game_concept_fire_gate_desc: "Alau Koev, meaning 'Fire Gate' in the Tsetnera language, is a religiously significant monument in Central Amaghea. The faithful claim that the realm of the gods lays on the other side of the monolith and that at any moment, the mountain shall witness the fires of another world once more. Because of its significance to local cultures, the site is jealously coveted. While the monolith is ancient, its status as the site of the fabled Fire Gate of Alau Koevac legend is highly disputed. The original accounts of the legend make no mention of the monument, and through the centuries over a dozen other sites have been claimed by various tribes to have been the true location of the ancient spell to equally scant proof." #NT!

 game_concept_black_martyrs_custodians: "Black Martyr's Custodians" #NT!
 game_concept_black_martyrs_custodians_desc: "Sacred caretakers of the Black Martyr's mad husk, they dress their charge in black robe and attempt to divide his deranged but oftentimes oracular ramblings into those that are incomprehensible to our mortal ken and those that can be deciphered with great effort. However, these custodians are at the best of times inaccurate and have but rarely managed to predict future happenings. Most believe this is due to custodians' imcompetance, while some blame the Black Martyr as not posessing true prophetic abilties.\n\nA more recent phenomenon has the Martyr's ramblings becoming almost exculsively about cataclysmic events, the Martyr itself growing more distressed by the moment." #NT!
 game_concept_giant_spiders_and_humans: "Giant Spiders of Redlands" #NT!
 game_concept_giant_spiders_and_humans_desc: "The Giant Spiders are reverred by some in the Redlands, who build lavishly decorated rooms in temples that the spiders call home. Sacrifice is common to feed the spiders and it is believed that serving them will result in bestowal of great power. They are also kept in city centers, their silk and poison leftover from the Feast made into sturdy armor and deadly weapon. They also defend these cities that they call home from attacks." #NT!
 game_concept_fallen_star: "Fallen Star" #NT!
 game_concept_fallen_star_desc: "The true origin of this extraterrestrial is vague, its moniker deriving from its supposed stellar origins as well as imposing appearance. Most say that its appearance as a figure hurtling towards the Redlands coincided with the sudden disappearance of a star in the night sky, and is unlike any creature known to exist. Possessing thousands of stonelike arms and legs, it is exceedingly adept in what appears to be Mind Magic and is known to teach a select few followers in the arts." #NT!
 game_concept_schism_of_moon_cult: "Schisms of the Moon Cult" #NT!
 game_concept_schism_of_moon_cult_desc: "The disciples of the Speaking Moon cult are strange and perplexing folk replete with various esoteric beliefs and traditions. Their tenets are often contradicted by fellow priests who come to different conclusions and interpretations, causing many schisms.\n\nOne of the most infamous schism was when one priest proclaimed that [aervalr|E] spoke to them about instructing the faithful to no longer wear clothes, which got rebuked by another claiming the opposite, creating a schismatic cyle that lasted a century until a third priest pronounced that Aervalr commanded no such change of the sort" #NT!
 game_concept_being_of_the_bloody_feast: "Being of the bloody Feast" #NT!
 game_concept_being_of_the_bloody_feast_desc: "The Being is said to have descended from the heavens to relay holy instructions to his chosen flock. Said to lurk within a great subterranean lair, it is said to possess an otherwordly beauty with an enchanting voice. Verbalizing its commandments to chosen priests in a strange and unnatural language, it is somehow innately understood by those who hear it. These commandments emphasize the sanctity of blood and speak of an enigmatic concept only known as the [bloody_feast|E]" #NT!
 game_concept_bloody_feast: "Bloody Feast" #NT!
 game_concept_bloody_feast_desc: "Upon the instructions of the [Concept('being_of_the_bloody_feast','Being')|E], the blood required for the Feast is collected with the utmost brutality involving careful dismemberment and flaying of the reservoir, preserving its life to the ritual's end. The sheer pain and suffering endured by the victim throughout the ritual is thought to draw the attention of outer entities who pave the path to renewal. The final steps to obtaining rebirth through the ritual are unknown, besides the fact that it requires an enormity of sacred blood." #NT!
 game_concept_hidden_kings: "Hidden Kings" #NT!
 game_concept_hidden_kings_desc: "The 'Hidden Kings' are said to be the true masters of reality by the Cult of Zagrillion Dance, that consider themselves their servants. Men turned gods, they are said to rule from a spiritual realm located within the hollow shell of [aeras|E] sending messages through magic to their followers. The cult treats exposure sickness and mutation as a holy sacrament to be experienced both personally and to be inflicted upon outsiders, all so the faithful may divine the will of the gods in its patterns." #NT!
 game_concept_origins_of_the_cult_of_zagrillion_dance: "Origins of the Zagrillion Dance Cult" #NT!
 game_concept_origins_of_the_cult_of_zagrillion_dance_desc: "It's commonly suspected that the Cult of Zagrillion Dance likely descended from a slave-cult established by one of the exiles from [aversaria|E],  as its pantheon of "Hidden Kings" is rather obviously cobbled together from the garbled names and personas of reigning Aautokratirs of antiquity." #NT!
 game_concept_elated_victim: "Elated Victim" #NT!
 game_concept_elated_victim_desc: "A woman of ethereal nature who manifests only within the tentacles of the great and venerable Kesrravarga, beasts notorious for their gluttony native to the Redlands. Her followers preach of the transience of life, and that pleasure must be sought at all costs. They are also known to frequently indulge in massive orgies that involve a mix of both lustful elation and murderous rages." #NT!
 game_concept_burning_maiden: "Burning Maiden" #NT!
 game_concept_burning_maiden_desc: "According to the legends that surround her, the Burning Maiden is a being that is periodically reborn on [aeras|E] to sow great discord and bring about change. Sometimes under the guise of casting down the wicked and evil, but just as often as nothing more than a power-hungry usurper. The one universal constant of her manifestations, however, is that she always has her life ended in fire, until born anew." #NT!
 game_concept_yalgabaot: "Yalgabaot" #NT!
 game_concept_yalgabaot_desc: "Yalgabaot is known as the God at the Center of the Universe and the supreme regent of the Unspeakable God, ruling over many other gods. Yalgabaoti cultists believe he and the other gods are incomprehensible and inhuman in aspect and thought; mortal men cannot understand them, and anyone who beholds their physical form is struck dead or is turned mad.\n\nThey believe the Unspeakable God is the originator of all things and the world is just a result of his dreams. That mortals are maggots before the gods" #NT!
 #GODS 
 game_concept_ertomax: "Ertomax" #NT!
 game_concept_ertomax_desc: "Ertomax was the fourth man to win over the disparate tribes of the Aruvasue, at least according to the records of the [aversarians|E]. Whilst his kingdom in the second century IS was the most successful state the Aruvasueni had ever seen, many differing stories have emerged about the man. Some stories claim he raised an army from the dead with [dead_magic|E] to conquer his way across Aironoi. Others say that it was his sharp wit and quick hands that won him his crown, charming his way across the lands of the Ja'Rakmar. Some even claim that the man who marched upon the Hill of the Golden Saint was not the same king to return to his capital to feast weeks later.\n\nWhilst a vocal minority at best in the early days of the kingdom, his cult has only ever grown throughout the centuries. Once thought a backwater cult, the Ertomaxist faction of the Zaribat Ekadri attempted to revive the empire of Ertomax in the chaos of the [bayyuralar|E]; instead, the High Priesthood of the Aruvasue shattered, and the glory of both Ertomax and the Aruvasue was permanently muddied." #NT!
 #DESCRIPTIONS 
 game_concept_izaerto_bosar_creation_myth: "Izáerto Bošáren Creation Myth" #NT!
 game_concept_izaerto_bosar_creation_myth_desc: "The Izáerto Bošáren believe in the 'Great Void' and its evil creations the 'Thousand Masters'. The Thousand Masters had the power to manipulate stars and would turn whatever living creature they touched into horrible abominations, their human slaves who toiled to create great dark shrines to them included. Humanity, as the Izáerto Bošárians tell, rose up and struck down the Thousand Masters in a horribly brutal rebellion, during which almost all of humanity died. As the Great Void turned its abyssal gaze to watch the destruction, humanity too struck the eldritch being in the mystical infinite plane from which it resided with an attack of the Thousand Master's own creation. Because of this, they claim the world is now doomed, for while darkness is banished, without darkness there can never truly be light and that all history thereafter is thus nothing besides the last pretenses of a dying world.\n\nFinally, they also believe that the counterpoint to the Great Void is a minor deity named the 'Feathered One', a giant mystical bird with rainbow feathers from which all light reflects and gives the world color. The Feathered One swallows the souls of all dying people and lets them enter the eternal paradise within them to live in peace forever while the mortal realm dies. Most foreign observers agree their faith is ridiculous, and the often agnostic faithful normally say that the stories are mostly metaphorical but the Feathered One is truly real..." #NT!

 game_concept_fools_curse: "Fool's Curse" #NT!
 game_concept_fools_curse_desc: "The Fool's Curse is a deadly disease originating from the [fools_coast|E] that has kept outsiders out of the otherwise verdant shoreline. Many attempts by [aversarians|E] to settle the Fool's Coast have been completely decimated by the curse. Despite its well known lethality, the curse has never afflicted the coast's natives. None know from where the curse originates, though Oltenic myth tells of rival warlords who sought power over a djinn, only for its magic to be turned against them." #NT!
