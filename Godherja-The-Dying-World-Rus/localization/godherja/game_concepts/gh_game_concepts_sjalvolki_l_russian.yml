 game_concept_sjalvolki_migrations: "Sjalvolki Migrations" #NT!
 game_concept_sjalvolki_migration_desc: "The Sjalvolki Migrations is a catch-all term that has come to describe the mass movement of peoples from the north and east of [the_continent|E] into [aversaria|E] itself following the disastrous events of [frodbrokna|E].\n\nBeginning shortly after the event, but beginning in earnest in the 1220's with the arrival of the [fog|E] in the Sjalvolki homelands, the migrations took organized shape after Cenware Witch-Breaker unified the various Sjalvolki clans as well as refugees from dozens of other cultures and religions into the Sjalvolki Imperrech under himself in 1244 IS.\n\nAfter convincing the tribal leaders to follow him south under the banner of the Imperrech, with the understanding that after each culture would be given new land in former Aversaria, Cenware looted the [mayikrata|E] for its secrets and then launched an invasion of Kalathipsomi. Still torn by warlords after the collapse of the Oraispol Aautokrata after the [imperial_civil_war|E] and facing mass slave revolts the local despots could barely contain, Cenware's seasoned force of Sjalvolki warriors, along with Partic magi and thousands of other non-Sjalvolki fighters, tore through the region in hardly a year. Soon after, he launched his invasion south into the core lands of Aversaria in Etepezea, the Battle of the Elysian Pass wiping out most of Aversaria's remaining military forces in 1252 IS." #NT!

 game_concept_dovatkning: "Dovatkning" #NT!
 game_concept_dovatkning_desc: "To follow the Sjalvolki religion is to believe oneself a member of a holy vanguard on [aeras|E], protecting against incursions from The Gods Above. To this end, the Sjalvolki traditionally elect their rulers through the ritualistic battle ceremony known as the Dovatkning. There, any [vassal|E] or kin of the previous ruler may test their mettle against any other, to determine their worthiness to rule." #NT!

 #GODS 
 game_concept_velos: "Velos" #NT!
 game_concept_velos_desc: "According to myth, it was Velos who first felt the light of the middle-realm. He was elected leader of the expedition by his siblings, who too were eager to leave [prohen|E]'s halls and quickly took up the mantle of chief god. To the Sjalvolki, Velos is a paternal figure who embodies the qualities which they value most, bravery, honesty and confidence. More than a mere hunting god, Velos is the guardian and protector of his people, his name envoked before honour duels, coronations or hunts in equal reverence. Perhaps his greatest achievement was the creation of the first bow, from the stolen hair of a Sky-God, knowledge which he granted mankind for their service in the war." #NT!
 game_concept_prohen: "Prohen" #NT!
 game_concept_prohen_desc: "It is austere Prohen who weaves and cuts our fates, according to the Sjalvolki. With his wife [marma|E] he fathered the gods, [velos|E], [pekwon|E], [pekielo|E], [varpalis|E], [zamistra|E] and [ureha|E] but instead of searching for new lands with his children, he travelled further underground below the halls in which souls go to rest. He is absent in most Sjalvolki legends, due to his seclusion but when he does appear he  is described as a blind hermit, his skin as pale as chalk and with hair that reaches his feet. Due to his enigmatic powers within Sjalvolki mythology, some consider him to be their true chief god, most notably the Gruelokin who dedicate various rituals and festivals to the Old Weaver." #NT!
 game_concept_ureha: "Ureha" #NT!
 game_concept_ureha_desc: "Ureha, the youngest sibling and only sister of [velos|E] is one of the most important figures in the whole of Sjalvolki mythology. Disturbed by the constant fighting between her brothers, over how the world should be formed, she decided to make more amiable company. So with her own hands, the first humans were sculpted. But soon after, the other gods began to use her creations in their own quarrels. So distraught with the violence which befell her people, she fled to lands which had yet been seen. Unbeknownst to her however, she was watched by the callous Sky-Gods and so from above she was taken to dwell among the clouds. So distracted were her brothers that mountains moved before they noticed her absence. By this time, she had grown accustomed to her new home but still harboured a longing for the land below the sky.\n\nA brutal yet inconclusive war between the Sky-Gods and the Earth-Gods was fought, where mankind was instrumental. It was agreed however, that Ureha may spend half the year in the Sky-Realm and the other half below. Her arrival in the Middle-Realm is marked by the largest of the Sjalvolki's festivals, celebrating the coming of Spring. " #NT!
 game_concept_pekielo: "Pekielo" #NT!
 game_concept_pekielo_desc: "Blinded in the War with Sky-Gods, Pekielo dedicated himself to the pursuit of knowledge. The raven Norus, who knows of all events that have transpired since the dawn of time, whispers into his left ear. Meanwhile, in his right whispers the owl Nora, who knows all that is yet to come. Pekielo has no control over the past or future but instead catalogues it in his 'Book of Days', its contents and location a mystery that not even [velos|E] himself knows. In one Saga, a shaman attempts to find the fabled tome and, against all odds, he is able to locate the cave in which Pekielo resides. To his utmost surprise, the deity hands him the book with no hesitation whatsoever. However, upon reading even a few pages he is overcome with such dread that he resorted to clawing his own eyes out in desperation, his mind so warped that his words became maddened screams." #NT!
 game_concept_marma: "Marma" #NT!
 game_concept_marma_desc: "Mother of the Gods and wife of the Old Weaver [prohen|E], Marma is often interchangeable with [aeras|E] itself. Her nature is tempremental, responsible for bountiful harvests and devastating famine, those who mistreat her great domain are doomed to suffer the consequences. Like her husband, she did not fight alongside her children in the war with the Sky-Gods and hence is largely indifferent to the lives of men, despite this many rituals are dedicated to her in attempt to gain her affection.      " #NT!
 game_concept_varpalis: "Varpalis" #NT!
 game_concept_varpalis_desc: "Humble Varpalis is thought to inhabit all the lakes, rivers and waterways which crisscross the Sjalvolki homeland. It is the duty of Sjalvolki anglers to leave an offering or portion of their catch to Varpalis, so that he may replenish the waters in which they fish. He prepares those unable to be buried for the afterlife and transforms stillborns and children who die young, into otters who are said to look over their families. Despite this, women are taught not to bath in water alone as Varpalis has a reputation as a lecher, father of many of the demi-gods of Sjalvolki myth." #NT!
 game_concept_zamistra: "Zamistra" #NT!
 game_concept_zamistra_desc: "Youngest of the Sons of [prohen|E], Zamistra is worshipped for his sharp mind rather than blade. Often depicted as a travelling bard, it is the role of a Sjalvolki to always welcome strangers into their home in case it may be Zamistra himself. He is credited as the first poet, a skill he taught the Sjalvolki people. Zamistra is often shown as a trickster, preferring cloak and dagger to the typical honest and headstrong solutions of the Sjalvolki. This puts him at odds with many of the virtues which his followers hold dear, making him particularly popular with those who fall outside the usual confines of Sjalvolki society such as merchants and [magi|E]." #NT!
 game_concept_pekwon: "Pekwon" #NT!
 game_concept_pekwon_desc: "Second in command to [velos|E] in the war with the Sky-Gods and some may even say the greatest fighter of them all. Pekwon's skill with his sword 'Striggyr' is the subject of many a saga. However, this only made his fall the more tragic. According to myth, Pekwon during the course of the war fell in love with a Sky-Goddess and wished to marry her in the realm above. When his brother Velos, heard of this betrayal, he was so fueled with rage, that he cut off all of Pekwon's fingers as he slept so that he may never wear a ring. Pekwon reached for Striggyr yet it simply fell out of his maimed hands.\n\nVelos' outburst of anger proved disastrous as without Pekwon the war quickly turned to the Sky-God's favour, forcing them to enter the negotiation table. When the bloody conflict came to an end and the God's gave gifts to mankind, brooding Pekwon gave the cruel gift of hunger and misery, so that the beautiful creations of the Gods may all wither and die. Despite this, Pekwon is still worshipped to some extent by the Sjalvolki the 'gift' of decay is what allows fallen warriors to enter the great halls of Velos and some even sympathise with his tale." #NT!

 game_concept_greensea: "Greensea" #NT!
 game_concept_greensea_desc: "Located in the north, the vastness of the Greensea defies description. Millions of acres worth of trees, growing so close together they often twist and merge together into behemoths thousands of feet tall. The canopy above is so dense it is said one can swim through the leaves as if it was water. The forest floor is practically untraversable; the space inside is dark and cold, with trees blocking the path at every turn. Wildlife is mostly hostile, with wolf-bats and barkskin sloth bears being the most infamous to would-be explorers.\n\nDespite these troubles, it is possible to survive and thrive in the Greensea. Historically, the Partic have built great cities and temples high in the treetops, connected together by rope bridges and constructed by molding the shape of the trees themselves. The most skilled [magi|E] on [aeras|E] have lived in this forest, claiming their power comes from Draíogann Dtocht, the World Tree located at the Greensea's center." #NT!
 game_concept_orispolj: "The Metropolis of Orispolj" #NT!
 game_concept_orispolj_desc: "Once, Oraispol was the heart of [aversaria|E], the shining capital of a realm that stretched from [chevalie|E] to Kashirya.\n\nBut [aversaria|E] is no more. Having fallen to Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' during the [sjalvolki_migrations|E], it has now become an enduring symbol of the triumph of the Sjalvolki. Most of the city is still intact, the Aversarian population having been spared when the city fell. Even many of the grand monuments are still intact, simply repurposed to celebrate the gods and cultures of the city's new masters. And Aversaria, a name once synonymous with Oraispol, now fades into the ruins dotting Oraispol." #NT!
