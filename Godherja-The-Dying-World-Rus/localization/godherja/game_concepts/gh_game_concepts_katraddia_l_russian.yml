 game_concept_doradalem: "Doradalem" #NT!
 game_concept_doradalem_desc: "The ancestral homeland of the Mondecny people, Doradalem was almost a perfect match for the Mondecny culture's traditional isolationism, cradled as it was between towering mountains and surrounded by a forest wall so dense that it is completely impassable at most points. These factors meant that the Mondecny were rarely seen by their neighbors, and the mysterious land beyond the forest wall was often feared as a mythical place of wonders and magic by those who lived outside it. Inside the wall, the Mondecny lived in scattered towns and hamlets, pursuing a rustic, even primitive lifestyle sustained by the almost unmatched fertility of the land upon which they dwelled. Their metallurgic skills never surpassed the knowledge to smelt copper, largely due to the lack of any significant internal warfare (The Dethedklan Kin-struggle being the one major exception) or invasion from the outside world at any point in Mondecny recorded history. To hear them tell it, in Doradalem their lifestyle had not changed a bit since the day the gods created [aeras|E] - a claim which, astoundingly, might even have been true." #NT!

 game_concept_cnevobarthane: "Cnevobarthane" #NT!
 game_concept_cnevobarthane_desc: "The peculiar god of the Theugombrians, Cnevobarthane is a solar deity usually depicted as a young man crowned with a brilliant halo and wielding a golden spear. It is believed by his worshippers that he is periodically reincarnated among them as an infant. The reborn God is unrecognizable at first, only regaining his memories and deific potency at puberty. Though there have been a few pretenders to this title throughout history proving the rebirth as genuine requires demonstrating powers beyond the ken of all but the most exceptional of Magi. Nevertheless, a the Speakers supposedly claim a list of nearly sixty canonical reincarnations going back over ten thousand years.\n\nWhile it is unclear just how much of that historical record is true, it has been noted that at least two of the three most recent Cnevobarthanes do seem to coincide with some of the most ancient legends of the people of the Continental Interior. These sparse handfuls of fragmentary written sagas and mutated oral legends speak of the rise of a successive pair of incredibly powerful Magi who were worshipped as gods a little over a millennia and a half before the rise of [aversaria|E]." #NT!

 game_concept_theugombrians: "Theugombrians" #NT!
 game_concept_theugombrians_desc: "The Theugombrians have no homeland. They have wandered the Continental interior since time out of memory, occasionally setting down roots on small patches of wasteland to farm or herd in heavily fortified communities, but more often roaming in great caravans, setting down fortified camps for a few weeks or months at most. Their culture stresses both discipline and martial training for youths of both sexes and they are often referred to by chroniclers and poets as an army without a country. Indeed they often sell their services as mercenaries or auxiliaries to anyone who will pay. Their culture seems to hold little guard for distinctions between sexes, placing equal responsibilities upon both men and women both within the Theugombrian household and while under arms. Additionally, It is not uncommon for Theugombrian women to take multiple husbands, sometimes up to three, though the reverse among Theugombrian men is exceedingly rare.\n\nTheir nature as permanent outsiders and nomads has made the Theugombrians the frequent victims of suspicion and distrust by their settled neighbors, an attitude they are more than willing to reciprocate if needed. While they have occasionally been the victims of mob violence, the heavily armed and militarized nature of their society means that this often ends badly for their aggressors, and most towns with a tendency towards xenophobic paranoia have learned to swallow their prejudices and leave them well enough alone in their fortified camps.\n\nTheir tightly knit kin-groups are based around matrilineal lineages which can in some families be reliably traced back over fifty generations. Indeed, a few of the oldest histories written by the societies of the Continental Interior mention a people clearly recognizable as Theugombrians, implying that they have held onto a discernable cultural identity far older than almost any people still extant on [aeras|E] today.\n\nThe Theugombrians do not, as a rule, recognize slavery. Captives taken in war are either sold back at random, executed if they have attracted some particular ire from their captors, or adopted into the clan itself if the prisoner proves themself willing and useful. In this manner Theugombrian clans can often develop quite a mixed ethnic appearance, with Kathunian, Sarradonian, and even Damotan ancestry not unheard of within individual families." #NT!
