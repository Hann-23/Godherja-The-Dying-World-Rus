 game_concept_odrstund_desc: "The Odrstund was a [gedeora|E] that struck [aversaria|E] in 1168 IS. The largest in generations, the Odrstund seemed to primarily target Aversaria [magi|E].\n\nOvernight, the [magical|E] aristocracy of the Aautokrata had their worst traits radically heightened. The callous became sociopathic, the cruel became bloodthirsty, the spiteful turned to hateful. The results (besides several serial murders) were not immediate, but quickly became apparent within a decade. With the Magi more destructive than ever, Aversaria began witnessing a rapid escalation in the number and scales of civil wars and internal conflict, with ten times the number of nobility being assassinated in 1178 than the entire decade preceding the Odrstund.\n\nAeschraes, leader of the Oraispol Aautokrata in the [imperial_civil_war|E], was born on the Odrstund. Whether this led to his casting of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] is hotly debated." #NT!

 game_concept_imperial_civil_war_desc: "The Imperial Civil War (or [aversarian|E] Civil War) was a conflict between Aautokratir Aeschraes of Oraispol and Aautokratia Axiaothea of Asiupoli that took place between 1186 and 1200. While one of thousands of civil wars in the Aversarianas Aautokrata over the years since its inception, the Imperial Civil War earned distinction for being the one that ended the Aversarinas Aautokrata and brought forth the [fog|E] with Aeschraes (one of the pretenders in the War) causing [frodbrokna|E].\n\nThe war began after the mysterious death of Aautokratir Anesimasios, and the accusation that his wife, Axiaothea, poisoned him. In the [blood_senate|E] following his death, Axiaothea destroyed the entire gathering and the assorted nobility with the few survivors quickly bending the knee to her. On her return to the cultural capital of Oraispol, however, a coup was launched by Legon Aeschraes and Legio XXI 'Aeschraes' (now 'Axiaothea'), who proclaimed her a false aautokratia and declared himself the rightful ruler.\n\nThe proceeding war lasted almost twenty years, leaving most of the Empire wartorn as nobility constantly shifted sides or broke off to form their own factions. The war was most notable for the increasingly extreme power of [magic|E] brought on by the rapid research and development of previously unused or underdeveloped spells. Entire cities were wiped out in massive magical blasts, southern Opakhasia was turn into a burnt out wasteland, and the war ended with a spell so large it brought forth Frodbrokna. While Axiaothea was killed in this spell, so was the Empire, and Aeschraes' own realm rapidly collapsed in the following years despite his 'victory'." #NT!

 game_concept_thaxaonic_blood_pact_desc: "The Thaxoanian Blood-Pact was a faction of [aversarian|E] [houses|E] that led an attempted coup and rebellion against Aautokratir Aeschraes in the immediate aftermath of [frodbrokna|E]. Led by the pretender-Aautokratir Jaxor 'Blood-Sparrow' Thaxaon and supported by a dozen noble houses in Etepezea and Malcois, it would ultimately be crushed by a campaign spearheaded by Kathryn Delenel after a near-decade of warfare.\n\nThough just the first in a long line of upheavals to befall the post-[imperial_civil_war|E] Oraispol Aautokrata, it had significant importance in stymieing Aeschraes' attempts to consolidate the power of his already flagging realm, and is seen as one of the major early factors that would ultimately lead to its downfall." #NT!

 game_concept_the_vilnian_assault_desc: "The Vilnian Assault was a battle taking place after the [imperial_civil_war|E] in the city of Oraispol, late in 1229 IS between the forces of Aautokratir Aeschraes of the reigning 'Oraispol Aautokrata' and Legan Isacea and her Legio XXI 'Axiaothea'.\n\nAs Aeschraes struggled to maintain his failing grip on [aversarian|E]—Aironoi in complete rebellion and the rest of the Empire drifting to anarchy—Legio XXI struggled to survive in Opakhasia. Having formerly been Aeschraes' personal legion (then titled 'Aeschraes'), they were brutally hunted throughout much of Aversaria by the Aautokratir's lieuenant [karthyn_delenel|E].\n\nIsacea resolved to end Aeschraes' rule, claiming the legion and Aversaria both would not be safe until the 'wicked Aautokratir' had been either killed or imprisoned, and resolved for the Legion to gather what allies it could and assault the capital.\n\nTogether with a Noble Legion gifted by by Despexir Hexon of Dymetra, a force of former-legionary's turned mercenary, and forces belonging to criminal organizations in western Etepezea standing in opposition to the underground network controlled by [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E], Isacea commenced her assault.\n\nThe attack was named for the Vilnian Gate (after Aautokratir Vilnian) around which the attack began. Disguised as merchants entering the city to trade from the northern village of Ilthia, Isacea and an elite force of forty men snuck through the gate and killed its guards, opening it to her force. Some thousand men either entered the city through the gate or threw off disguises they had been wearing across the city, and soon fought their way through the city and towards the Imperial Palace at the crest of Aexionarax's Hill.\n\nAfter finally reaching the throne room with heavy losses, Isacea and her remaining force attempted to kill Aautokratir Aeschraes, who ordered Demetros Iron-Spike and Karthyn Delenel to slay her after a short confrontation. The events thereafter are unclear, but the assault would end in falure. Iron-Spike and Delenel, along with the rest of Aeschraes' top guards, [magi|E], and his inner circle were slain in the battle (Iron-Spike and Delenel in single combat with Isacea). However, Aeschraes managed to kill the wounded Legan, and Legio XXI and its allies were fought back and out of the city with heavy casualties.\n\nDespite Isacea's failure, the assault would nonetheless be partially successful. The Oraispol Aautokrata was killed in the assault, with Aeschraes' entire inner circle who held the tenuous construction together slain and the prestige of the Aautokratir ruined, order outside of Etepezea utterly collapsed. Without allies and his rule collapsing, the Governor of Etepezea (Lycus Xenepheron) performed a coup against Aeschraes and usurped control of Western Etepezea, ending the rule of the Aautokratir." #NT!

While the war technically began with Methiad's guerilla war against [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] and would continue after Iron-Spike's death in the [vilnian_assault|E], the conflict is most well known for the arrival of Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' in 1247 IS.\n\nNicanoneus would work for both Methiad and Gurdurbok during his entrance into the conflict. Most notably in his assault on the Methiad-alligned fortress of Tarwek and the assassination of Gurdurbok loyalist Eldradd 'Bane-Star' Pithicladd.\n\nNicanoneus was given soldiers by both sides to battle the incoming [Concept('sjalvolki_migrations','Sjalvolki')|E] where he'd become the first [aversarian|E] to defeat Cenware Witch-Breaker in the Battle of Bergkoga, but would be quickly sent north after failures to secure his victory. Nicanoneus blamed both sides for this, and turned on his erstwhile 'allies'.\n\nNicanoneus' men would ambush Gurdurbok in his estates in Ariosniai and his men successfully managed to assassinate the barbarian leader in the battle. Soon after, he would march west to deal with Governor Dethlycan, who sent assassins and her personal legion both to stop his advance. Both would fail, the assassins being caught by Nicanoneus' personal guard and her legion defecting to the invader, and Dethlycan would soon after be caught attempting to escape west into [chevalie|E] and be executed by Nicanoneus.\n\nWith the war over, Nicanoneus assumed control of the north, and the Black Mountain War would soon lead into the [ash_war|E]." #NT!
 game_concept_ash_war: "Ash War" #NT!
 game_concept_ash_war_desc: "The Ash War (or the Rohrian Annex) was a bitterly fought campaign in northeastern [chevalie|E] between 1248 IS to 1251 IS between the forces of the [chevalien|E] Duke of Faisitelbouren (Duke Rhaon II den va Sissaux) with his ally King Ansfrei den va Seignon and the Partic tribe of Calagonii against Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' and his Imperial remnant.\n\nAfter executing his opponent [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Methiad Dethlycan')|E] at the end of the [black_mountain_war|E] for 'incompetence and betrayal', an attempt was soon after made on Nicanoneus' life by still loyal agents of the former governor. While it is not known if they were acting out of revenge or simply had not known their master had fallen, what is known is that the agents were largely paid for by money given by her ally Den va Sissaux. In desperate need of supplies to fight the [Concept('sjalvolki_migrations','Sjalvolki')|E], Nicanoneus used this as an excuse for a campaign west, hoping to exploit the civil war in Chevalie to gain supplies to fight his southern war.\n\nWhile the [aversarians|E] initially made great gains, the mysterious arrival of the Partic soon threw the situation into doubt. Partic [magi|E] wreaked great havoc on Aversarian supply lines outside of the Chevalien [antimagic|E] Field, and Calagonii tribesmen fighting alongside Marcher knights soon drove the Aversarian forces back east.\n\nThe lines eventually settled in eastern Muisle, where trenches and battlements were dug so that Aversarian Magi could throw fire onto the fields before them while obscuring themselves from Chevalien griffon riders. This period of static warfare was reinforced by the creation of multiple siege castles by both sides.\n\nThe war ended in 1251 IS when the Marcher-Partic alliance commenced an all-out assault against Nicanoneus' forces near the [lichdoms|E], using the hostile terrain and somehow timing their assault alongside a raid by the [lich|E] Ilnar Illadir. Nicanoneus was maimed by a firebolt from a Partic Magi and during his two-week coma, his forces were routed back east into the Black Mountains.\n\nVictorious, there was debate amongst the Marchers about a possible invasion to [Concept('marcher_aversarian_wars','reclaim their ancient fortresses')|E] in the mountains, but this was cut short by the reasonless betrayal by their Partic allies. The Partic Magi slew the Duke of Faisitelbouren and soon after conquered most of the Rohrian plains, ending the war decisively, and in the east a surviving Nicanoneus would reorganize his men and realm into Epavarion - the Ebony League." #NT!

 game_concept_turmoil_of_the_sixteen_aautokratirs_desc: "The Turmoil of the Sixteen Aautokratirs was a period of widespread anarchy and civil warfare that engulfed [aversaria|E] in the wake of [odrstund|E], spanning from 1169 IS to Anesimasios' (ultimately short-lived) reunification of most of the empire (excluding Katraddia, parts of northern Kalathipsomi and Krehejad) in 1181 IS. The culmination of more than a century of Aversarian decline, the Turmoil would prove to be one of the most destructive civil wars to grip the empire since the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], and though it would later ultimately be overshadowed by the [imperial_civil_war|E], many of the political fault lines and key players that would play pivotal roles in the latter conflict first achieved prominence in this decade-long conflageration.\n\nDespite its name, the epoch undoubtedly saw more than sixteen individuals pretend to the title of Aautokratir, the oft-cited number mostly only referring to those that held Oraispol or Asiupoli for some length of time and not including the various provincial warlords that never came close to controlling either. Many of these would-be rulers of Aversaria would come to be regarded as some of the most tyrannical and incompetent that the empire had ever seen - the monstrous Aeolus 'Bileblood', the prophet-magi Kyrgos and his Cult of the Purest's Flame, and the ruthless Mountani sisters (along with their famed rivalry) being only some of the infamous despots to rise and fall in the period." #NT!
 game_concept_war_of_all_islands: "War of All Islands" #NT!
 game_concept_war_of_all_islands_desc: "The largest seaborne invasion in the history of [aversaria|E], perhaps in the history of [aeras|E], the War of All Islands was the Empire's last effort to forever remove the E'hat'mic pirates who had plagued the Shattered Coast since time immemorial. The beginning of the war is considered to be the massive series of raids perpetrated by the E'hat'm queen Iezatha of the Baotaadar against Imperial shipping in 963 IS, in flagrant violation of the various treaties that had been signed with the E'hat'mic rulers of the southern archipelago. In response to these provocations, Aautokratir Oliatos proclaimed that the E'hat'm, as had been displayed, were impossible to negotiate with, and began laying plans for an invasion of unimaginable scale and scope, to begin as soon as the fleet was assembled. Lacking any formal navy, however, the Aautokratir chose to send out a proclamation across the Aautokrata, promising land in Krehejad to any who joined the fleet, and great rewards to the first to set foot upon the island. This offer was seen as incredibly appealing by the impoverished Islanders, and soon the various mooring points were filled to the brim with enthuisiastic crews, rubbing shoulders with a massive collection of State Legions, all preparing for the operation. In addition, they were joined by a sizable contingent of slaves, offered freedom and the right to settle on the islands should they serve with distinction.\n\nCome the spring of 966 IS, the fleet embarked, and though the voyage itself was not without incident—with several Islander captains taking the opportunity to assail their rivals—the chaos which the invasion would come to be known for by its veterans truly began when flags belonging to the E'hat'm were spotted ahead. Behind them, however, was land, which prompted a mad rush by several vessels to be the first to claim their promised reward. The battle itself, immortalized as the [battle_of_the_imperial_sea|E], ended in victory for the Empire, and though the war would continue for the next several years, by 967 IS the land grants were doled out to those who had earned them, and the Archexate of Krehejad was born, a client kingdom subservient to the Empire." #NT!

 game_concept_battle_of_the_imperial_sea_desc: "Happening during the War of All Islands, the Battle of the Imperial Sea is the name affixed to the [aversarian|E] landing on Krehejad. Pitted against the assembled navy of the E'hat'm—a people who had been sailing the high seas since before the Aautokrata had even been created—was the Imperial fleet, assembled from countless Islander flotillas, Legions, and noble entourages. The battle has a well-earned reputation for chaos, as both sides lacked rigid command structures, with individuals Legons and captains having near-complete control of their ships. As a result, once battle was joined, formation broke apart completely as each vessel chose its own individual targets, while Imperial and E'hat'mic [magi|E] decimated entire flotillas.\n\nSoon, the chaos spilled onto the land, as Islander vessels and ambitious Legons rushed ahead to claim the rewards promised to the first to make landfall, resulting in several instances of friendly fire as Aversarian vessels fought for the honor. In an unexpected twist, however, this chaotic landfall would lend the Empire an advantage, as the E'hat'mic fleets who tried to retreat onto the land often found their ports of origin already occupied. The Battle of the Imperial Sea is considered to have ended when the remnants of Iezatha's fleet chose to flee Krehejad, retreating to the southern colony of Ketruna." #NT!

 game_concept_demetros_detheniax_desc: "Demetros 'Iron-Spike' was a Northern [aversarian|E] warlord who maintained control over much of Kalathipsomi in the early 1200s. The bastard son of the noblewoman Kena Detheniax and (if rumors are to believed) Vedegar Brethaniac, the semi-legendary master of many of the criminal organizations in Aversaria during the peak of the [imperial_civil_war|E]. Iron-Spike was born in relative squalor in the shadows of the [mayikprolollan|E] in Prose on 1202 IS.\n\nCunning and shrewd, Demetros managed to use intrigue, guile, and intimidation to take the majority of his mother's lands after her death in 1209 IS; either killing or removing her trueborn heirs in the decade after her death. Demetros soon ruled most of his family's lands and began to rapidly expand them through further subterfuge and campaigning for the next decade.\n\nDemetros is perhaps most known (or infamous) for swearing fealty to Aautokratir Aeschraes, using the backing of the 'Lord of the Ashes' to further extend his domain towards the Black Mountains and begin what many considered a legal criminal organization that held much sway throughout Etepezea. Soon, Demetros had become known as one of the right hand men to Aeschraes, and many lords remained under the Aautokratir's grip entirely for fear of the assassins known to be employed by the Iron-Spike and his myriad of criminal connections.\n\nDemetros was slain in 1229 IS by Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' during the [vilnian_assault|E], alongside his counterpart [karthyn_delenel|E] in a duel with Isacea. With Iron-Spike's death (with no accepted heir), order in Kalathipsomi rapidly collapsed into infighting between revolting slaves, military commanders, criminal organizations and local nobility, and would remain in such a state until the Sjalvolki [migrations|E] in the 1250s." #NT!

Legon of Legio XIV 'Chain-Forgers', Delenel was known for his brutality and efficiency in command of his legion primarily in dealing with slave revolts throughout the [imperial_civil_war|E] and afterwards in service to Aautokratir Aeschraes.\n\nDelenel is perhaps most infamous for being considered the mentor to Gorassos 'Skull-Taker', the infamous 'attack hound' to Aeschraes who cut bloody swathes through [aversaria|E] alongside Delenel in fear campaigns to horrify the population back into order under the rotting foundations of the Oraispol Aautokrata. Delenel was given commands of five legions for this assignment, as well as his personal noble legions from his families extensive estates in Opakhasia and Malcois, and is generally credited for Aeschraes being able to control the two regions for the later part of his reign. Known for skinning his enemies alive, Delenel would use his limited magical ability to prolong their lives and would often also castrate, de-tongue, de-hand, and then skin notable captives in front of their men or families while giving speeches in Aeschraes' name.\n\nDelenel would meet his end in 1229 IS at the hands Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' during the [vilnian_assault|E], alongside his compatriot [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] in a duel with Isacea. With Delenel's death, his legions immediately deserted Aeschraes' service, Opakhasia collapsed without his fear campaigns and Malcois was soon swept under the tides of the Iyrossi Rebellions.\n\nOften forgotten in popular accounts is that Delenel survived the Vilnian Assault though was mortally wounded. Abandoned by his allies and men, he returned to his estates in Opakhasia. There, his pupil Gorassos entered under signs of friendship and then beheaded his master for his collection of skulls, then raped and killed Delenel's family, servants, and slaves. This is commonly cited as the moment that Gorassos broke what ties remained between himself and Aeschraes." #NT!

Initially an Aversarian legionary, Gurdurbok would take the north after deserting with fellow clansmen from his Legion (Legio XVII 'Pathos'), and would control the north under the command of [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E].\n\nWhen Iron-Spike was killed in the [vilnian_assault|E], Gurdurbok formally cut ties with Aversaria (in a very well written letter to Oraispol), and soon after began a war in the mountains with rebel [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Methiad Dethlycan')|E] for control of the north. Gurdurbok was known for using freed slaves to do battle, and showed great cruelty to Aversarian settlers who resisted him. Despite this, and propaganda written by his rival Methiad showing him as a true barbarian, Gurdurbok was known for his great interest in literature, foreign theology, and the arts, and would often impress visiting emissaries by extensively debating these topics with them.\n\nGurdurbok met his end in 1247 IS with the arrival of Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun', child of the governor of Katraddia. Entering the region with his refugee army, Nicanoneus was routed around the eastern mountains after his defeat by Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' in the Mountain Gate War.\n\nNicanoneus would be courted by both sides in the [black_mountain_war|E] and would use forces from both Gurdurbok and his rival to score a victory against the Witch-Breaker in the Battle of Bergkoga, but would soon after be forced back north. Followed hotly by the Sjalvolki, Nicanoneus would blame his 'allies' for the defeat and deemed both too much of a liability for his cause. He would surprise and kill Gurdurbok in an assault on his estates, and then execute Governor Methiad and assume control of the north, ending the north's period of civil conflict." #NT!

An ardent Axiaotheist and oft titled 'Aversarian among Aversarians' by her contemporaries for her imperious bearing and absolute refusal for compromise with those she considered of lesser blood, Methiad was born into her role and began a bitter campaign of rebellion against the warlord (and her co-governor) [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] and his patron Aautokratir Aeschraes.\n\nMethiad was a powerful [magi|E] in her own right, and controlled a cabal of Magi called the Seven Watchers, often considered the strongest Magi in the north alongside her allies in the [mayikrata|E]. Not only this, but Methiad received numerous arms and funding from the [marchers|E] of [chevalie|E], with whom she had made numerous deals for generous land and resource grants in the Black Mountains. With this force she fought Iron-Spike and his ally and her chief rival [oulnir_gurdurbok|E].\n\nWhen Iron-Spike was killed in the [vilnian_assault|E], the guerilla war between Methiad and Gurdurbok broke into full open conflict, and would consume the north for the rest of her life. Both sides would fail to make substantial gains, especially with the rest of Kalathipsomi in open collapse, and Methiad's position was thrown into even greater doubt with the collapse of her allies in Chevalie (with the disappearance of High King Gardfrei) and the Mayikrata (with [Concept('sjalvolki_migrations','Cenware Witch-Breaker leading the sack of the academy')|E]).\n\nWhen Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' arrived from the east alongside his refugee legions, Methiad and Gurdurbok both attempted to [Concept('black_mountain_war','court the foreigner to their sides in the conflict')|E].

Blaming his 'allies', Nicanoneus soon after ambushed and killed Gurdurbok. Methiad suspected she was his next target, and attempted to send assassins as well as her personal legion to kill her former pawn. The assassins failed however, and her legion quickly deserted to Nicanoneus. Surrounded and without allies, she attempted to flee to Chevalie, but would be captured and then executed for incompetence by Nicanoneus in 1247 IS. Her attempt to escape west, along with another attempted assassination against Nicanoneus by her followers soon after, would be used by the Black Sun as an excuse to invade west into Chevalie in the [ash_war|E] soon after." #NT!

Ruled by the Aversarians, Aversarian culture is highly [magic|E] based, believing that only Aversarians possess 'pure' blood, and that the worthiness of a person is decided by the purity of that blood. Aversarian society has a fairly strict social hierarchy based around this belief, with slaves at the bottom, non-Aversarian freemen above them, non-magical Aversarians above them, and progressively powerful [magi|E] above them to the top of the social hierarchy. Most Aversarian Magi are [blood_magi|E], and its ease of use and commonality within Aversaria have generally made it the most common form of magic on the continent.\n\nAversaria ruled most of the continent since 0 IS (Imperial Standard), which was the year of the formation of the Aautokrata. Scholars generally agree that Aversaria was united from a series of city-states in southwestern Etepezea shortly prior to this date by one of the region's many Magi-warlords, and would control most of the Shattered Coast within 200 years of its formation." #NT!

 game_concept_mayikprolollans_desc: "A mayikprolollan (literally translated to 'magic academy' in Common [aversarian|E]) is any Aversarian school dedicated to the teaching of magic along the guidelines set by the Concordial Pact and the Treatise of Good Practice that govern legal and acceptable Aversarian magic. By Imperial law, all Aversarian citizens who show magical ability are required to be allowed to learn in a mayikprolollan, and at the peak of the empire, there were thousands across the empire of various sizes competing for students and prestige. While technically dedicated to magical pursuits, the mayikprolollans often offered full teachings of the sciences, mathematics and history, and even non-Magi citizens and foreigners from outside the empire often received their education through them.\n\nThe most famous and notable mayikprolollans are the [pathosixyic_academies|E] of Kalathipsomi and the [mayikrata|E] chief among them. It was considered a high mark of prestige to officially graduate as a Magister of the Mayikprolollan, a title only the Mayikrata could officially grant. After centuries of becoming mired in political feuds, however, the Pathosixyic Academies would officially sever ties with Aversaria in the [month_of_the_magi|E] and the mayikprolollan system itself would largely collapse and vanish from [the_continent|E] with the contemporary events surrounding [frodbrokna|E] and the collapse of the Empire." #NT!

For over a thousand years, Oraispol enjoyed a place of prominence, as the center of traditional Aversarian power, balanced against the rising eastern Governorate of Aironoi. It was where the Agionist Saints faced trial, where the Aautokratir Anesimasios was murdered. And most recently, it was the center from which Aeschraes reigned during the [imperial_civil_war|E].

Built upon an ancient and unfathomably huge labyrinth that was discovered by Aversarian explorers in the seventh century and of an unknown creation potentially thousands of years prior, the Mayikrata served as both the preeminent school for acolyte Magi and the epicenter for magical study and archival.\n\nWhile untold amounts of Aversaria's developments and discoveries in the arcane arts were thanks to the Mayikrata and its child schools, and it would host and train some of the most legendary and acclaimed Magi in Aversarian history, it would also become one of the most infamous and damaging institutions to the Aautokrata. Due to having unfettered access to the most highly connected youth in Aversaria, the Mayikrata and the rest of the Pathosixyic Academies would often use their position to indoctrinate or even blackmail its students into becoming political puppets. Alongside a wide breadth of less known incidents among instructors abusing their power over their students for other means, the Mayikprolollan would often put students it saw as less important, of less potential worth, or who seemed unlikely to become pawns into excessive danger, using them to experiment with dangerous or unknown rituals or to explore the extremely dangerous depths of the Mayikprolollan itself.\n\nThe Mayikrata would host both Aautokratir Aeschraes and Aautokratia Axiaothea who would go on to lead the [imperial_civil_war|E], the rivalry and future infamy of the two often blamed on the excessively cruel education they received therein. Thereafter as Aversaria collapsed following [frodbrokna|E] and the academies became increasingly isolated, the Pathosixyic Academies would declare independence from the Aversarian realm in 1218 IS with the [month_of_the_magi|E], ending their histories as institutions of learning, political intrigue, and widespread incompetence." #NT!

While other mayikprolollans would rise and fall in fame and fortune, the Pathosixyic Academies (the Mayikprolollan sto Spathas, sto Thallas, and chief of all the [mayikrata|E]) would not only be the first three to be formed but also become the informal leaders of all other academies.\n\nAfter their true founding in the eigth century IS, the leaders of the three Academies would convene to write the second edition (and the most important) of the Concordial Pact and, several years later, the Treatise of Good Practice, which would come to dictate the proper and legal teachings of all Aversarian Magi along with the correct usage of magic. Not only schools, the Pathosixyic Academies would also become economic centers and the most important laboratories on [the_continent|E], both building the largest known archive of magical knowledge and artifacts on [aeras|E] and becoming centers for learning and experimentation. Despite this, however, the Pathosixyic Academies would become known for their increasingly political nature. Using their unique position of isolating and controlling the children who would one day be the most influential powerbrokers of Aversaria, the Mayikprolollans often sought to turn their students into political puppets through a mix of social pressure, financial debt, and very often even blackmail and threats.\n\nThe legacy of the Academies as prestigious institutions of learning would end after [frodbrokna|E] and the collapse of the empire during the [month_of_the_magi|E] in 1218 IS, when the Mayikrata would declare itself an independent aautokrata separate from greater Aversaria, followed by similar declarations from its two child academies." #NT!
 game_concept_month_of_the_magi: "Month of the Magi" #NT!
 game_concept_month_of_the_magi_desc: "The Month of the Magi was a series of events (actually taking place over two months and three weeks) that culminated with the [pathosixyic_academies|E], the most important of the [mayikprolollans|E], declaring independence from [aversaria|E] and their freedom from Imperial law. The events began in 1229 IS when Arch-Magister Terrox of the [mayikrata|E], a contemporary (and poorly regarded) student of Aautokratir Aeschraes (whom with he hosted a largely one-sided rivalry) and Aautokratia Axiaothea (with whom he hosted a far more one-sided romance), successfully purged his last rivals among the Academy staff and ruling Council and took absolute power of the Academy. After several years of battling internal rivals and disrupting the rule of Aeschraes in the Imperial collapse after [frodbrokna|E] and the end of the [imperial_civil_war|E], Terrox finally saw the [vilnian_assault|E] as evidence that Aeschraes could no longer pose a threat to the Kalathipsomian academies and shortly thereafter declared himself an independent aautokratir with no connection to the Aversarian realm and formally closed the institution to students from those he deemed 'loyalist families to the false aautokratir'.\n\nWord of the declaration would only reach the Mayikprolollan sto Thallas and sto Spathas a month after as several thousand copies of a near two hundred page declaration of independence reached the cities with orders for them to be shipped to rulers across Aversaria and as far as Kathun-Kai (it is commonly believed that in doing so, Terrox effectively ended Aversarian bookmaking, the last magic-based printing systems (the method of their creation lost in the 11th century) used by Magi breaking down from overuse and the resulting booklets being considered little more than paranoid self-centered ramblings undeserving of being possibly the last pieces of Aversarian literature).\n\nFollowing the declaration, the Mayikprolollan sto Spathas would hastily declare solidarity with Terrox and swear fealty to his aautokrata — the academy and surrounding city's economy closely tied to the Maikyrata. In the following month, however, the chaos following the event and the further collapse of Kalathipsomi into feuding cliques would lead to four separate legions declaring intent to besiege the city, the city then declaring independence from Terrox and working with several nearby power-brokers to also obtain neutrality from foreign affairs in return for its own safety. The Mayikprolollan sto Thallas meanwhile would face great internal strife from the announcement, the campus of the Academy soon falling into civil war and the city around it — ostensibly independent from its affairs — falling into its own among political and economic lines. Only after 'the Magicoup' would the academy's council manage to form union with local authorities and emerge victorious and kill most of their opponents in a bloody night of assassinations. The city would then declare complete independence as well, ending the Month of the Magi with around 120 dead (over 90 of which were in the Mayikprolollan sto Thallas) and ending the Mayikprolollan's histories as academies for Magi." #NT!

 game_concept_blood_senate: "Blood Senate" #NT!
 game_concept_blood_senate_desc: "A 'Blood Senate' is both the name for the accepted succession system of the Aversarinas Aautokrata and also for the actual gathering of nobility to perform it.\n\nFirst began in 243 IS after Aautokratir Akalionixos declared that whichever one of his sons could prove themselves the strongest [magi|E] may succeed him, he was soon after murdered by his daughter Maklea in an impromptu duel, who was shortly after declared aautokratia and spent the rest of her reign largely hunting down her brothers. This was its origin however, and a thousand years of formalization and correction to attempt to prevent massive civil wars nearly every generation have led to its modern iteration.\n\nIn the modern world, a Blood Senate is declared just after the time of mourning for the former Aautokratir. The high nobility of the realm choose an agreed upon location and each noble family puts forward one candidate to compete, though other members are allowed to volunteer as well (though this is taboo) and non-nobles are also allowed to join, though this is also taboo.\n\nDuring a Blood Senate, the assorted candidates compete in a bracketed tournament to find who is the most powerful Magi via duels to the death, with no mercy allowed at risk of disqualification. The last man (or woman) standing wins.\n\nOnly one Blood Senate has been won without [magic|E], by the Aversarian mercenary Nothyx, who used [antimagic|E] skills learned from the [marchers|E] to put down his competitors with nothing besides his sword." #NT!

While Aautokratir Phanagorax is often credited with the conquest of the Iyrossi Valley, most scholars agree that the conquest would not have been possible without Dethediax's skill (especially when compared to the oft debated competence of the Aautokratir).\n\nDethediax was known for her sharp wit and great knowledge of the Iyrossi, born from having been the master of Aversarian forts in northern Opakhasia before the Mytidon Campaign. Dethediax was appointed military governor of the valley after the conquests—often claimed to be the first governor of Malcois despite it not being an official Imperial province until 288 IS—and managed to create a code of laws and regulations that ensured the valley faced no major rebellion after her own death.\n\nWhile contemporaries accused Dethediax of Iyrossi sympathy, especially due to several portions of the law directly challenging the severity of Aversarian rule and circumventing many Imperial laws, it nonetheless managed to fuse old Iyrossi codes with Aversarian law to create a lasting peace between the two groups. Most notably, it used the Iyrossi rules of 'Blood Service' to create a palatable reasoning for the subjugation, and ensured that most Iyrossi would live as 'Autonomous Slaves' in independent communes named 'Iyroikons' which gave them far greater autonomy than most Aversarian slaves.\n\nWhile the Laws would be changed, rescinded, or reinforced multiple times during history (especially with the Theyssian Reforms in 766 IS), they nonetheless remained largely in place until the Iyrossi Rebellions in the 1200s." #NT!

 game_concept_aversarinas_aagiokratia_desc: "The Aversarinas Aagiokrata (or Imperial Humanity in Aversarian) is the official state religion of the [aversarinas_aautokrata|E] (similarly, Imperium of Humanity) and the historically largest religion in [greater_aversaria|E]. The religion itself is highly decentralized, with Aversarinas free to choose one of many local or foreign monastic orders and sanctioned cults to dictate their practice and interpretation of Aversarian scripture. What is agreed upon by all schools, however, is that Aversarians are the true representations of humanity. The Purest arrived on [aeras|E] at some point in the past and either were joined by or then created the [first_men|E]. The Purest was the first and most powerful [magi|E] in history, and gave the gift (assuming they did not already possess it) of magic to the First Men in return for their fealty, allegedly becoming the first aautokratir.\n\nThe loose structure of the faith and the cynicism of the Aversarian aristocracy in late Imperial history have led to the religion often being used for little more than to control the many conquered peoples of Aversaria. Generally, when Aversaria does not outright wipe out the peoples or cultures of a region, they will twist local belief to fit into the Aagiokrata in some form (normally conflating local gods with the Purest and mandating religious practice through law). Cultural assimilation then begins, with portions of the population being declared Aversarians and resettled elsewhere, until finally the people's are all considered Aversarian in nature if not in blood or are wiped out through military cleansing, with their cultural cult either disbanded or brought even further in line with mainstream belief and largely sidelined." #NT!

 game_concept_westerly_breeze_desc: "North of the Sea Tower, at the edge of a secluded reef, lies a curiosity. Here a stone hand of immense scale juts from the sea, clutching in its grasp the splintered remnants of a wooden vessel. While presumably a part a larger statue its scale has meant that none have been able to dive deep enough to glimpse more than its wrist. When [aversaria|E] colonized the region, scholars noted it as a peculiarity, but being unable to identify the make of the vessel it was largely forgotten about for the time.\n\nThis all changed in 1022 IS when a startling observation was made by the scholar Machyos Nottiokos: the vessel clutched within the statue's grasp, once deemed to be of an unrecognizable yet distinctive design by previous scholars, was actually very clearly of contemporary Aversarian design. Leading the first expedition to examine the vessel in centuries, he determined that the heavily rotted wood couldn't have been harvested earlier than the 10th century IS. Indeed, one of the better preserved nails even bore a maker's mark from a blacksmithing guild still active in the Tinitida area.\n\nWhile this mystery would fruitlessly consume the next decade of Machyos' career, it largely remained a local curiosity and his work was ignored until the disappearance of the "Westerly Breeze". The vessel, a state of the art trade ship sporting a novel design, vanished without a trace in the midst of a magical storm in the Southern Isles. Noting that the sketches of the ship bore more than a passing resemblance to his research project, Machyos led a third and final major expedition to the site. There, tearing off a large section of rotted hull and carefully studying the reliefs, they discovered the faintest trace of the words "Westerly Breeze" carved onto it." #NT!
