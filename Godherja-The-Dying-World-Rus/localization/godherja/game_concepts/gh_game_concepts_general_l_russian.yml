 game_concept_aeras_desc: "Aeras is the name for the sole inhabited planet around which revolves the sun and the cosmos. Although many religions ascribe its creation to a multitude of gods, or to one god, its was in truth made by an [ancient_god|E] who longed for company. Scarred by ancient wars, disasters, and an [Concept('aelfir','alien')|E] race, Aeras has a long and forgotten history and has faced more dooms than anyone can really know." #NT!

 game_concept_prehistory_desc: "Prehistory is considred any time not on the modern [imperial|E] calendar. Aversarians believe the world was founded at 24,000 BE by the 'Purest'.\n\nIn actuality, the [Concept('aeras','world')|E] was formed anywhere from 20,000 to 400,000 years before this. As hundreds of different ways to track time have passed, and time as modern humans know it has not always existed (possibly only truly starting after the Godherja) it is impossible to accurately date most of human history.\n\nRoughly, [aersanon|E] created the world after several aeons in the void, and then created humanity to attempt to make beings to converse with. Humanity was allowed to create its own kingdoms, all which worshipped Aersanon, but Aersanon grew tired of humanity's imperfections and created the [aelfir|E]. The Aelfir conquered and enslaved humanity and formed their own empires, and after several hundred thousand years, humanity rose up and destroyed the Aelfir and Aersanon both in the Godherja." #NT!
 game_concept_marcher_aversarian_wars: "Marcher-Aversarian Wars" #NT!
 game_concept_marcher_aversarian_wars_desc: "The Marcher-Aversarians Wars were a series of conflicts between the [marchers|E] of [chevalie|E] and the [aversarians|E] roughly between 344 IS to 631 IS, though skirmishes and border wars have been common before and after.\n\nThe Wars began in earnest in 344 IS with the invasion of [black_emperor|E] Yakub 'Illspeaker' Yakovad into Chevalie, which brought most Chevalien forces in the Marcher colonies in what is now Kalathipsomi back to the homelands to resist the invasion. Rebuffed from Aironoi by the Astliks and recovering from the Last Dragon Rebellion, the Aversarians invaded the Marcher colonies in their ever-growing desire to dominate more lands.\n\nThe initial war was hard fought, with Yakub 'Illspeaker' eventually defeated, Marcher [antimagi|E] wreaked havoc upon the Aversarians using guerilla tactics against the rugged outlands of Kalathipsomi. The initial series of wars only ended in 569 IS, when both sides, thoroughly exhausted and struggling to resist outside threats while dealing with the other agreeing to draw a new border. Aversaria would gain the majority of Kalathipsomi with the Chevaliens retaining the Black Mountains and all lands west of them.\n\nSeveral smaller wars would be fought for the mountains themselves until 631 IS when the [bloodblight|E] wiped out much of Chevalie's nobility and the Marchers withdrew west, Aversarian settlers soon filling their former holdings. The modern border between de-jure Chevalie and Aversaria has remained since." #NT!
 game_concept_chaos_of_the_seventh_century: "Chaos of the Seventh Century" #NT!
 game_concept_chaos_of_the_seventh_century_desc: "The Chaos of the Seventh Century was a series of disastrous series of events that began in the late 5th century and ended around 760 IS. While the chaos primarily struck [aversaria|E], it nevertheless also struck much of [chevalie|E] and [sarradon|E]. While many scholars believe that it was simply poor luck, others have suggested that it was in fact a powerful [gedeora|E] which inflicted poor luck upon [the_continent|E]\n\nThe Chaos began with the invasion of the [arch_lich|E] Adwaga Adwakampy into Chevalie and the rise of the Aversarian [lich|E] Count Themos in eastern Opakhasia. As the two Liches wreaked havoc, especially due to a collapse in Marcher authority and the Aversarian throne being sat on by a mere child, a powerful series of Gederða began tearing Aversarian cities back and forth through the timeline seemingly at random. Further exacerbating this was a large civil war that quickly broke out between the governors of Kalathipsomi and Malcois in the midst of the invasions.\n\nNot long after, the [bloodblight|E] began its rampage across the world from Aversaria. With the southwest weakened from these calamities, the [kartharadd_imperium|E] launched a massive invasion into Aversaria and conquered most of Malcois, only being beaten back after a brutal near fifty years of war which ended with the defeat of the last Kartharaddi army at the Battle of the Riduvian Barrows in 760 IS, marking the end of the Chaos." #NT!
 game_concept_frodbrokna_desc: "Frodbrokna is the name given to a series of cataclysmic events that transpired on 1.3.1200 after the Aautokratir Aeschraes unleashed Self Replicating Blood [magic|E] onto [the_continent|E]. This wreaked wide spread havoc and devastation across [aeras|E], killing nearly half of the [aversarian|E] population, untold numbers in the wider world, and stripping many survivors of their control over magic. While his target, Axiaothea, was killed in the blast, it is unclear whether that was due to the spell's success, or the mass devastation.\n\nThe sheer power and horror brought into being was so great, that reality shattered—cracking [aervalr|E] and bringing forth the [fog|E]." #NT!

One of many 'Gods', Aersanon was the only one even comprehendible to humans in any form, for Aersanon made humans in Their image and the bounds of their mind are drawn by the limits of their perception of Aersanon.\n\nAersanon created humanity out of a desire to find companionship, but was disappointed when humanity proved to be unable to meet them at their level. Despite humanity worshipping Aersanon as a god, Aersanon cast them aside and created the [aelfir|E]. Happy at the improvements made, Aersanon was nevertheless disappointed with the inherent cruelty and insanity in their blood, and began a third project when They were struck down during the Godherja.\n\nThe dead mind of Aersanon, or at least of Aersanon's image on [aeras|E], is the source of [gedeora|E], [odrstund|E], and [frodbrokna|E]. Their blood is the source of [living_magic|E], their body the source of [dead_magic|E], and their mind the source of [mixed_magic|E]. [magic|E] is more powerful around the [towers|E] from which They ruled, and along the paths upon which They tread.\n\nTens to hundreds of thousands of years since their 'death' (insofar as such a concept applies to a God), Aersanon has been forgotten by all besides the most childish or esoteric of fairytales and religious lore." #NT!

She, along with her four children (the dragons Iluthunax, Parthagad, Olaxanat and Kutharax) proceeded to scour much of Aversaria, exacting tribute from local lords of wantonly slaughtering entire cities as they saw fit.\n\nArthenax slew the entirety of over six Aversarian Legions and over two hundred [magi|E] who attempted to stop her before finally being confronted by Aautokratia Aeliadias in a legendary duel in southern Opakhasia. Aeliadias proved herself the strongest Magi of a generation in killing the beast and her children. The magical flames conjured by Aeliadias were so powerful that Arthenax was burned away until her bones turned into blackened stone, and her remains still remain where they fell so long ago. While Arthenax is considered the last living dragon, it is unknown from where she came from, and the believed extinction is only due to the lack of verifiable reports of other dragons since." #NT!

 game_concept_fogeaters_desc: "Fogeaters are the [mutated|E] remains of humans who were left trapped in the [foglands|E] after [frodbrokna|E]. Whether they can still be considered human, mutated human, or a form of [fogbeast|E] is hotly debated, and little is known about the particulars of their 'culture' or beliefs.\n\nWhat is known is that they were once a series of tribes scattered across the far northeast, and unlike most who die when trapped within the [fog|E], they instead adapted to it and changed into something different. They now uniformly worship what they call the 'Mistmother', a personification of the fog, who they believe speaks to them through it.\n\nFogeaters themselves have little remains of human sentience, generally little more than gibbering wrecks who have only retained enough sentience to perform raids and ambushes out of the foglands and kill themselves upon capture. Physically, they possess an unnaturally pale skin from which many of their veins and sometimes even organs can be seen through, and unnaturally spindly and ill-proportioned limbs. Their eyes retain multiple colors not seen in other humans as well, including reds, purples, whites and blacks. Blindness is prevalent, though they seem unnaturally immune to most known sicknesses, and have far less need for food or water in comparison to humans. Despite this, cannibalism is extremely common, somehow connected to their odd religious beliefs." #NT!

 game_concept_aelfir_desc: "The Aelfir were the second project of [aersanon|E], created in Aersanon's continued quest to make a being They could consider Themselves equal to.\n\nThe Aelfir were considered an improvement over humans. They were far superior at [magic|E], bred less, lived longer, and were generally considered far smarter and stronger. While looking similar to humans, they possessed long pointed ears, alien yet exceptionally striking facial features, and shades of skin going from ivory to black to blue.\n\nThe Aelfir's greatest flaw was in their cruelty. Obsessing over their own image and power, the Aelfir regularly brutalized one another and especially humans in attempts to further their own power. Aersanon saw this as a weakness and strove to fix it with a third project, but was stopped by the Godherja and Their apparent death.\n\nThe Aelfir formed multiple empires across the planet before their destruction in the Godherja, from which they reigned for several thousand years with humanity toiling as a brutalized slave caste. After humanity stole their magic and wiped out the race, they have been almost completely forgotten from history. The closest to memory of the Aelfir is from the [aversarians|E] who worship a pantheon of 'First Men', and the Sjalvolki whose tales of [creatures|E] from the 'Gods Above' contain mentions to Aelfir, though they are considred minor demons and little more than monsters." #NT!

Almost identical in design, each are made of a strange and alien black stone and generally stand taller than any other buildings in human imagination. Religions and cults have often risen up around these towers, their beliefs reinforced by the powerful [magics|E] radiating off them.\n\nDespite the massive interest in the towers, nobody is known to have ever seen the interior of one, as each is surrounded by a deadly magical field.\n\nThe most famous of the Towers is the [sea_tower|E] (or the "Imperial Tower" to [aversarians|E]), which is claimed to have once been the throne of the 'Purest'.

 game_concept_dragons_desc: "Dragons were [godtouched_creatures|E] that primarily resides in [aversaria|E] and parts of northeastern [sarradon|E] from an unknown period until roughly the the mid 200s. Ferocious and massive reptilian beasts, dragons could breath fire, ice, or poison upon their foes, fly with massive wings, and showed an intelligence at or above a human level. They were capable of complex speech, though only the one(s) they spoke to could seemingly hear their voice. Dragons would come in a variety of colors based on the contents of their breath, and would normally travel in packs of up to six-a mother and father couple and their children, normally splitting once the children either found mates or created their own packs.\n\nDragons were rare but not entirely uncommon in their homelands along the [shattered_coast|E] and it was considered a high honor in Aversarian society to be declared a Dragon Rider upon taming one of the creatures, normally through forming something akin to a friendship with it. The rise of Aversaria coincided—partially due to Aversarian breeding programs—with a marked increase in the dragon population, and by the War of the Thousand Dragons there would be over 800 recorded Dragon Riders belonging to various cliques and fraternities across Aversaria.\n\nDragons were seemingly wiped out during and after the war, first from battle and then later after Aautokratir Aexionarax deemed the remaining dragons too dangerous and had them slaughtered.\n\nThe most famous dragon in history was [arthenax|E], commonly believed to be the last living dragon." #NT!

Griffons possess the body and back legs of a lion, with the head, wings and talon of an eagle. Considered highly respectable [creatures|E] in the Marcher mythos, many Marcher folk heroes are griffon riders, and knights riding griffons is a traditional image representing the [antimagic_orders|E].\n\nIt is unknown if Griffons have become more rare due to the growth of human settlement in Chevalie of if ancient tales simply overstate their population, but older Marcher sagas tell tales of armies of Griffon riders. In the modern era, Griffon riders are considered somewhat rare, normally limited to royalty and elite units fielded by the Anti-Magic Orders, several of which maintain stables of Griffons and take great pride in breeding the animals. It is tradition for each of the major Anti-Magic Orders to offer a griffon to a newly coronated monarch. The monarch choose the griffon themselves, and then train with the Anti-Magic Order that raised it to learn how to ride the creature and do battle from its back.\n\nGriffons are considered highly intelligent, Griffons more exposed to humans normally seeming to be able to understand spoken language and able to respond to complex sentences, though they are unable to actually speak any human tongue.\n\nHippogrifs are considered a kindred beast to Griffons, native to the Black Mountains to the east of Chevalie, but are believed to have gone extinct from overuse by Marcher knights during the [marcher_aversarian_wars|E]." #NT!

While the exact cause and circumstances of its emergence have remained almost completely obscure, the first known sightings by remote colonies, frontier legions and tribals coincide with the immediate aftermath of [frodbrokna|E] and the end of the [imperial_civil_war|E], leading many to believe that the mass chaos and evils of the conflict somehow drew it forth.\n\nNothing lives in the [foglands|E], at least nothing natural. Those few who have visited its cold interior and lived to tell the tale describe an immense feeling of dread, of constantly being watched and surrounded by a relentless litany of panicked whispers and unnatural sounds. Whatever one fears can be manifested in the Foglands, monsters of man's own creation taking corporeal form and attacking them as they wander, and living on to persist to another day. These [fogbeasts|E], along with other strange [creatures|E], wander the Foglands and attack any trapped inside. And that is not to mention the [fogeaters|E].\n\n[mixed_magic|E] is claimed to draw its power from the Fog.

 game_concept_exposure_sickness_desc: "Exposure Sickness is a catchall term for a variety of ailments arising to excess exposure to [magical|E] energies. Generally this happens due to proximity to magical places of power such as ancient temples, wayline crossings or magical battlefields, but is also found in [magi|E] who gather excess power. It is not to be confused with ailments resulting from casting spells requiring an excess of power than what the caster possesses, which is normally called [overwhelmation|E].\n\nExposure Sickness normally begins with headaches, fevers, dizziness and vomiting. At higher levels of exposure it can manifest in the bleeding of the eyes and nose, vomiting of blood, hair and skin loss, and the sloughing of skin. [mutations|E] are common at heightened levels, and at the highest levels of exposure, it has been reported that the afflicted can disintegrate, spontaneously combust, melt, or quite literally explode, assuming they do not simply expire." #NT!
 game_concept_overwhelmation: "Overwhelmation" #NT!
 game_concept_overwhelmation_desc: "Overwhelmation is the result of [magi|E] attempting to cast spells in excess of what their bodies are physically capable of. Normally the result of rookie Magi unsure of their own limits, or Magi in moments of life or death desperation, Overwhelmation normally results in painful death. Combustion, disintegration or explosion are the most common results, other times the spell they are attempting to cast may backfire upon them or those around them. A blast of fire may simply ignite the Magi, attempting to crush an enemy's blood may lead to an explosion of the arms, or attempting to heal a grievous wound to the melting of the Magi's nervous system.\n\n[aversarian|E] researchers in the [mayikprolollans|E] predicted that approximately up to a third or more of Magi not from a magically gifted family or of unknown birth will die of Overwhelmation after casting a spell by accident or in trying to discover their powers." #NT!

 game_concept_bloodblight_desc: "The Bloodblight was a disease that rocked most of [the_continent|E] and [sarradon|E] during a period known as the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], though the disease has had smaller outbreaks since. The disease is generally agreed to be magical in nature, though its origins are unknown. Victims normally show traits similar to [exposure_sickness|E], most likely due to the disease itself rapidly increasing the levels of magic within the victim. Victims normally show glowing, pulsing red veins, bleed from the nose, eyes and ears, and will normally expire from blood loss after rapid skin loss. If they survive this, then they normally die from the lining of the lungs collapsing, and their chests filling with blood. Bloodblight spreads most rapidly to Magi, though mundane humans are still prone to it.\n\nThe effects of the Bloodblight outbreak of the Seventh Century were massive and longreaching. In [chevalie|E], the first High King in a generation along with his entire extended family were wiped out and the Chevaliens forced to withdraw from their last colonies in the Black Mountains. In Aversaria, an entire generation of the nobility were destroyed, leading to mass societal collapse and a near dissolution of the Aautokrata. In Sarradon, the structured and elite magic class, the Sirhad, were almost entirely destroyed. Without the Sirhad to direct and control magic on the continent, the following generation would throw out most established norms and standards from their predecessors, and begin a rapid arms race to discover new horrifying and powerful spells for war. This would eventually lead to the discovery of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E], and by extension, [frodbrokna|E]." #NT!

 game_concept_selfreplicating_blood_magic_desc: "Self-Replicating Blood Magic is a name for a series of rituals and a spell which is commonly believed to be the most powerful and dangerous spell known to humans. An exceptionally complicated spell, Self-Replicating Blood Magic is only castable by the most powerful of [magi|E] and normally requires numerous others to assist them.\n\nThe spell detonates the target in a massive pillar of flame, and quickly does the same to anyone within the blast radius and beyond, spreading even further to Magi or others with magical properties. While theoretically it can be contained to a specific radius or group, the spell is extremely difficult to control, and there has never been casted in recorded history without the caster rapidly losing control.\n\nThe spell was thought lost after its discovery and use by the competing [sarradonian|E] Qurati and Almadi Magi cabals, who wiped themselves and nearly all of the continent's Magi out in the blast and brought anarchy across Sarradon for nearly a century after. It was later discovered by Legon-Aautokratir Aeschraes and Aautokratia Axiaothea during the [aversarian_civil_war|E]. While both prepared to cast it, only Aeschraes managed to in time, and ended up killing 80% of Aversaria's Magi, nearly half of the population otherwise, and wiped out millions otherwise across the entirety of the world. The pure magical power of the spell and the suffering it caused would open [the_rift|E] and bring forth [frodbrokna|E]." #NT!

In [aversaria|E], the chief source were the mines of the northern fringes of the Empire, taken from the [chevalien|E] centuries ago.\n\nThe locations where it has been found are, without exception, extraordinarily hazardous.

However, while their concoctions may be abundant and affordable, they rarely do true justice to the potential power of alchemy. The potent vials of pure, liquid force from Kathun-Kai, on the other hand, are often able to rival powerful conventional magic, and fetch an accordingly high price.\n\nIt is well known in the west that in the mysterious far-eastern lands of Kathun-Kai that the reverse is true, with Alchemy being seen as the most important of the magical arts.

The intersections of these two lines are commonly the most magically powerful locations in the world, and are often places of strange phenomena.\n\nWhile modern Magi are mostly in agreement that the two Waylines are indistinguishable in power, many folk tales claim that the Northern Wayline is one of dark magic while the Tower Wayline is one of neutral or good magics." #NT!

 game_concept_skittish_game_desc: "Skittish creatures are easily scared and will flee at the first sign of trouble. Though this means they are nearly completely safe and will not fight back if attacked, they are more difficult to hunt down due to their constantly high alertness.

 game_concept_cautious: "Cautious" #NT!
 game_concept_cautious_uppercase: "CAUTIOUS" #NT!
 game_concept_cautious_game_desc: "Cautious game is more acutely concerned with self-preservation than most, and will usually avoid fights unless cornered. Though they might retaliate if given no other out, they will rarely bother to finish a fight, even if it is going in their favor, and instead merely make their escape as soon as possible.

 game_concept_unyielding_uppercase: "UNYIELDING" #NT!
 game_concept_unyielding_game_desc: "Either due to a complete lack of self-preservation instincts, extreme arrogance, or simply the actual inability to flee, unyielding creatures will never try to flee a fight.

 game_concept_fast_uppercase: "FAST" #NT!
 game_concept_fast_game_desc: "Fast creatures are capable of notable agility and speed, and are hence more likely to be able to flee once push comes to shove - and are nearly impossible to escape from if they are aggravated.

 game_concept_intelligent_game_desc: "Some creatures go well beyond being merely intelligent for an animal, and are simply intelligent - period. They are very possibly sapient and at the intellectual level of a human, or in rare cases, perhaps even higher. Some may even be capable of speech, if they have any interest in dialogue.\n\nWhat this means in practise is that the game is exceptionally difficult to ambush, is far more proficient at ambushing itself, and is far more likely to retreat if it is at a disadvantage compared to the hunter." #NT!

 game_concept_cunning_uppercase: "CUNNING" #NT!
 game_concept_cunning_game_desc: "Cunning creatures possess remarkable wit and forethrought, and are more difficult to deceive than the average beast.

 game_concept_huge_game_desc: "Huge game towers over humans, and is likely able to kill with a well placed stomp if need be - presuming they are able to do so, of course.

 game_concept_elusive_game_desc: "Elusive creatures are not only rare, but difficult to track - their trail can seemingly vanish into nothing in a matter of moments, either as a result of generally leaving little in the way of evidence of their activity, or due to their movement being highly erratic and unpredictable." #NT!

Remaining a powerful influence within the overarching Aruvasue fold, his supporters continue to await the day that he will return to resume the purification of the world. Many have been claimed to be the beloved Ertomax, but few have survived long enough to fulfil his legacy." #NT!
 game_concept_armazli_mountains: "Armazli Mountains" #NT!
 game_concept_armazli_mountains_desc: "The Arnazni faithful believe that the Armazli Mountains that protect them from the northern barbarians were made by their ancestors who held godlike magical powers; however, as time went on, these beings started to lose their might due to becoming content and soft. An exception to this were the three brothers; [arnaz_azot_zalden|E]. Disgusted by their peers' new habits, the three of them made a new mountain. Arnaz, being eldest and wisest, was crowned High king. After Parnaz slew Azot in a duel for the high kingship, the  great mountain where his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it." #NT!
 game_concept_arnaz_azot_zalden: "The Arnaz Brothers" #NT!
 game_concept_arnaz_azot_zalden_desc: "Arnaz, Azot and Zalden were three brothers and were said to be one of the many ancestors of the Amagheans that held godlike powers. Disgusted by the increasingly lax and content nature of their fellow peers', the three set out to build a new mountain. Arnaz the Eldest and Wisest was crowned High King and set out on a conquest to unify the land. However, during the wars, his brother Azot became jealous at his success and betrayed him, slaying Arnaz and claiming his throne for himself. Before his death, however, Arnaz cursed everyone leading to a great reduction in magical capabilities. Furthermore, Arnaz proclaimed that his son would kill Azot and reclaim the high kingship\n\nAnd so it was that after many years, a young man named Parnaz, with aid from Zalden, would slay Azot in a duel and reclaim the throne. The great mountain on which his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it. Parnaz would reign for many centuries, and many in Amaghea today would be related to him." #NT!
 game_concept_xaxbaxakanax_esotericism: "Xaxbaxakanax Esotericism" #NT!
 game_concept_xaxbaxakanax_esotericism_desc: "Due to their exceptionally simple set of beliefs compared to other contemporaries, many find their faith extremely esoteric. As such, it is believed(by the Aversarians at least) to be most likely caused by them having been exceptionally primitive and disparate when their few historical realms were consumed by their neighbors. Very few realms have held power over them.\n\nAnd so, when their homelands were conquered by the Aversarians, they saw it as just yet another in a series of petty despots that would always come and always go, and as such, the faithful largely avoided harsh treatment by being too minor to achieve notice" #NT!
 game_concept_evil_lore: "Evil Lore" #NT!
 game_concept_evil_lore_desc: "Askevaryaans describe 'Evil Lore' as the knowledge that entered the world against Sarvat's wishes thanks to the efforts of evil demons and gods. To please Sarvat's wishes and ensure that the world is as they wished, 'Evil Lore' is to be destroyed and wiped out. This has naturally led to Askevaryaans regularly burning down libraries across Kashirya in an attempt to erase remnants of ancient and dark rituals." #NT!
