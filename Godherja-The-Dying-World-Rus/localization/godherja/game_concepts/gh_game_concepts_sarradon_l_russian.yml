 game_concept_mubaaizun: "Mubaaizun" #NT!
 game_concept_mubaaizun_desc: "A mubaaizun is a champion of a [sarradonian|E] army; often the best warriors of a lord will participate in a ritual duel before the battle commences, fighting to the death. These duels are often accompanied with each army chanting or insulting one another, and there have been instances - such as the [battle_of_the_mubaaizun|E] - where multiple duels happen before battle commences, often to avenge a dead mubaaizun.\n\nIt is permissible to flee a duel if a mubaaizun knows he's lost, and the other mubaaizun can only chase him so far before having to retreat. These duels can have a tremendous impact on an army's morale, and some battles have been averted entirely because of a lost duel. Anyone capable of fighting can be a mubaaizun, and there are a few commanders in history that have been their own champions. Mubaaizun are traditionally not [magi|E], and are usually swordsmen clad in personalized and resplendent armor.\n\nMubaaizun duels have fallen out of favor ever since the arrival of the [aversarians|E]; most Aversarian commanders are wholly disinterested in appointing mubaaizun or in participating in the customs of [sarradonians|E], though there are a few exceptions." #NT!

 game_concept_war_in_heaven_desc: "The War in Heaven was the brutal near-1000 years of conflict between the [wardenites|E] and [ritualists|E] from 296 IS with the rise of The First Warden to 1237 IS with the fall of the last independent Ritualist ruler. While the war contained dozens of various sides of many different faiths that would rise and fall on behalf of one of the sides (or both or neither), the main conflict always surrounded the warlords of the Ritualist and Wardenite faiths.\n\nThe war was extremely bitter and brought widespread devastation to [sarradon|E]. While the continent had several high points during the midst of the conflict, it was always soon ended by a continuation of warfare. The use of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] by the competing Qurati and the Almadi [magi|E] Cabals led to seemingly the end of Sarradonian prosperity, wiping out 80% of the Magi population and millions otherwise.\n\nThe 'war' (which was actually dozens of smaller conflicts over the time period), began to end with the arrival of Agionist, [chevalien|E] and [aversarian|E] merchants and mercenaries from [greater_aversaria|E] in 1144 IS. The northerners initially opened up several trade posts and brought new life to a continent still recovering from the destruction of Self-Replicating Blood Magic. Initially, they simply bought more and more land, but then began greatly expanding their reach by outright taking land from the Sarradonians. The war officially ended in 1237 IS with the Siege of Gromze, the last free castle of the Ritualist faith in Sarradon. While the following (and partially concurrent) [saints_war|E] is sometimes considered a continuation of the war, most Sarradonian scholars see it as a separate and new conflict." #NT!

While the [ritualists|E] seem to have fared worse in the ensuing chaos, few among the [wardenites|E] could count it a victory, as millions lay dead in a continent-wide conflagration that left both factions scarred and broken.

 game_concept_the_downfall_desc: "The period of civilization-wide chaos and anarchy that followed [halakdun|E], the exact period this era covers are unclear, with different regions of Sarradon returning to stability at different times. Regardless of the exact time frame, the period saw societies across the southern continent radically reforged in the crucible of chaotic wars and starvation. Perhaps most notably, The death of the last Eastern [mamur|E] al-Hudi and all of his family but his daughter [sanad|E] during [the_decimation|E] saw the Central Mamuramat absorb its final rival for authority over the [wardenite|E] Faith, fundamentally reshaping the religion of [the_first_warden|E] in the era to come. For its part, the Central Mamuramat faced its own crisis, as the Mamur Yusar - a magi of particularly noteworthy power who had survived the Halakdun was driven mad by exposure sickness, and in the end was slain by his son [tathtali|E] after a costly civil war." #NT!
 game_concept_battle_of_the_mubaaizun: "Battle of the Mubaaizun" #NT!
 game_concept_battle_of_the_mubaaizun_desc: "In 656 IS, the armies of [khuzaima_al_zuhra|E] met the [wardenite|E] army of Nasir ibn Nasir at the fields of Ad Vojessin, where Nasir ibn Nasir rode before Khuzaima's army and challenged his [mubaaizun|E] to single combat. [fihr_ibn_kilab_ibn_zayd|E], foremost of Khuzaima's Mubaaizun, accepted the challenge and duelled Nasir ibn Nasir, beheading him a minute into the duel. Nasir ibn Nasir's own champions - Yuqub ibn Hasan, Jafar al-Sarlata, Suleiman ibn Yusuf, Aziz of the Pillars, and Haqim ibn Nasir - subsequently challenged Fihr to single combat. Slaying each of them, Fihr cut off their heads and demanded that more combatants step forward, and despite the injuries he suffered during the duels, no one else challenged him.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the duels, Khuzaima's forces charged the Wardenites and nearly routed them, though the bannerman Ghalib managed to rally the Wardenites. This rally was short lived when Khuzaima and his retinue routed the enemy cavalry, turning around and attacking the Wardenite rear. In the ensuing tumult, Khuzaima was thrown from his horse and broke his leg, but Wardenite forces were routed and suffered high casualties.\n\nThe battle has since gone on to be one of the most famous in [sarradonian|E] history, mainly because of the unusually large number of duels between Mubaaizun, leading to both [ritualists|E] and Wardenites romanticizing it. Neither Khuzaima nor Nasir employed any interesting strategies, and the battle is rarely studied." #NT!

Under [wardenite|E] control, Khuzaima was ambushed three times on his way to the settlement by Khalid al-Asir, who wreaked havoc in Khuzaima's camp and dealt him great casualties. Though Khuzaima contemplated retreat, much of his remaining army was comprised of Zatani'a zealots who would revolt or desert en masse were he to do so - not to mention that the greatest of his [mubaaizun|E], [fihr_ibn_kilab_ibn_zayd|E] was a Zatani'a himself.\n\nKhuzaima continued on his way to Sulaymaniyan, where he conducted a siege of the settlement. Khalid al-Asir committed many night raids on Khuzaima until the second week into the siege, when he fought the warlord in a pitched battle. Khuzaima was shot in the throat by the archer Haziz ibn Qareh, and Khuzaima's greatest champion - Fihr - either died of grief or fell on his own sword moments later. Though Khuzaima's Zatani'a soldiers and Mubaaizun fought to the death, the rest of his army quickly fled the battle.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Khalid had the Ritualists buried, sending Khuzaima's body back to the [black_confederation|E], though he cut off Fihr's head and kept it as a trophy." #NT!

 game_concept_sarradon_desc: "Sarradon is the name for the arid continent south of [greater_aversaria|E]. In the intense heat of the south, the coastlines maintain lush and cool climates thanks to seawind while only a scant few leagues outside their view the land rapidly turns to desert and rocky badlands. To the center of the continent, the land is turned to jungle thanks to eastern winds and several great rivers and lakes, which is home to the Adabyssian Empire.\n\nSarradon has been hotly fought over for thousands of years, the home of [war_in_heaven|E] which has consumed its politics for nearly 2000 years after the rise of [wardenism|E]. While extremely wealthy in minerals, commerce, and culture, multiple devastating events have led to large depopulation and famine across most of the continent. Most notably the use of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] in 802 IS that wiped out over 80% of the northern portion of the continent's Magi and most of the ruling class, leading to mass anarchy that soon after led to the Agionist and [aversarian|E] colonization of the region.\n\nTo the far south of the continent, tales tell of the Axoquilekko Empire which has been bitterly fighting the Adabyssians for hundreds of years. To the east, the Strait of Knives separates Sarradon from Aironoi and [the_continent|E], and tales speak of a time in which it was once directly connected by land. Through the strait, trade from the mysterious lands of the far east greatly enriched the west, though the twilight of Sarradon and the fall of Aversaria has left it choked with pirates." #NT!

 game_concept_sarataratin_militarism_desc: "While originally far more militaristic, the modern Saratarat faith split (the original incarnation now referred to as Saratadibe) after the devastating efects of [halakdun|E] which killed nearly half of all of the holy saratans upon which the faithful reside, along with much of the rest of [sarradon|E]. Between the death of so many saratans upon the backs of which most Saratarians live (and drowned with as they fell to the sea) and the deaths of thousands of Sarataratian faithful on those saratans that survived, the Sarataratian faithful entered a deep collective trauma.\n\nAfter the priestly caste of all saratan's met upon the great island of Shaqerbi (which they also maintained was formed upon the remains of the first saratan) in the Mathatto Prayer, it was agreed that further warring between the faithful would mean the death of the last saratans and their protectors.

These texts are written in an ancient language which is known to none, and has yet to be truly deciphered(despite the claims of numerous [nosanni|E]), but some have claimed a strange feeling of familiarity with its script. In spite of considerable Manat efforts to keep their hoarded Sacred Texts under the protective custody of the [nomera_dikirib|E], the number of remaining original Texts has dwindled over time.

 game_concept_manat_mythology_desc: "The Manat believe that the Gods once lived among humanity on [aeras|E], both ruling over them, and teaching them everything they know. The gods were ruled by Relyon, the first god, who created the universe, and his wife Astoret, who cared for humanity more than any other god. The Gods kept the vast amount of knowledge they had, which was more than even the most advanced societies of humans have today, within libraries all across Aeras, where all could acess them. However, one day, a human named Atar grew envious of the Gods, so he riled up a mob which began burning down all of the Gods' libraries, until only one remained. Left with only a single library, barely any of the vast stores of knowledge they once had, the Gods decided to leave Aeras, bringing their last library and the land around it with them, forming a great crater in the land, and that last library becoming the [divine_library_of_the_gods|E]. This library now needed to be protected at all costs, so the god of war, Ashema, stepped up to do so, becoming the first librarian.\n\nAfter the Gods left humanity behind, Astoret began to cry so hard she began to flood the world, creating the ocean. However, she would not stop crying, threatening to flood all of Aeras. To console her, Relyon told his wife he would allow the most righteous of humans, who still followed the laws set by the [manat_sacred_texts|E] left on Aeras, would be allowed to enter the Divine Library after death, for until then, all humans would have their souls devoured by the great worm Mod after they died. Astoret, gladdened by this plan, stopped crying, saving humanity. To determine whether people were following the Sacred Texts or not, the thousand-eyed goddess Yarikh was tasked to watch the humans on Aeras, though she could only do so while she was awake at night time, as the blinding light of the sun prevents the gods from seeing down to Aeras during the day. However, as the followers of Atar began to destroy the Sacred Texts, Relyon's youngest son Lokan began to feel that this arrangement was still unfair to the humans, as if they do not have the Sacred Texts, they have no way of knowing how to follow them. So, he began micheviously stealing texts from the Divine Library, and hiding them on Aeras, in the hopes that humans would find them." #NT!

And so, under their father's orders, the eleven loyal sons marched toward Bidil'el, the traitor's stronghold. Conflict broke out in Bidil'el. A beautiful land was reduced to ashes as the brothers fought. And in the last battle, Comerah, the most loyal Malikiyah, was mortally wounded in his duel against Eir'Shaytan. Such heresy enraged Eloi who struck down the traitors and buried their corpses in the depths of Bidil'el where no one would remember them. Then, due to a request made by his dying son, Eloi spared mankind but instructed them that to return to heaven they must behave in a righteous and honorable manner.

 game_concept_sirhad: "Sirhad" #NT!
 game_concept_sirhad_desc: "A lost relic from the time before the Halakdun, the Sirhad were a highly organized caste of Magi whose power and influence were entrenched throughout central and eastern Sarradon. Their origins were nearly mythical - lost in the depths of Sarradon's early history and likely predating Ritualism itself. Any Sarradonian who showed magical potential would be inducted into their ranks - sometimes against their will, as the Sirhad believed that unregulated Magi posed a threat to Sarradonian society and to the authority of the Sirhad as a whole. As marriages within the Sirhad were heavily encouraged, Sarradon became home to a large number of very potent magical bloodlines whose lineages went back millennia. Intricate records of these bloodlines were kept in the Sirhad's greatest stronghold, now known only as The [sunken_house|E]. This magical citadel was kept hidden somewhere in the depths of the Khibkhibirin, protected from outsiders by devilishly complex wards and illusions.\n\nDuring the [war_in_heaven|E] the Sirhad remarkably remained neutral in the conflict. Although individual members were allowed to hold sympathies, the organization forbade any direct involvement or favoritism using the Sirhad's considerable resources. Any magi who participated in the war did so as an individual, and could count on no support from the senior leadership. Even more remarkably, this idealistic nonpartisanship seems to have actually worked quite effectively, and the Sirhad's services as middlemen and neutral negotiators became almost as invaluable as their services as magi." #NT!
 game_concept_mizfarun_dawl: "A'Mizfarun Dawl" #NT!
 game_concept_mizfarun_dawl_desc: "A clandestine cult operating cells within the [sirhad|E]'s broader structure, the Mizfarun Dawl operated across multiple cabals and regional caucuses throughout Sarradon. Through spying, targeted assassinations, and calculated atrocities they acted as the hidden dagger of the Sirhad, protecting its interests and avenging its defeats. More ominously, they were not above directing their attentions inwards, blackmailing or even murdering [sirhad|E] Magi who threatened to rock the boat. Rumored to have been followers of an exclusively practiced mystery cult whose rites are otherwise unknown, they put their considerable influence towards cementing the [sirhad|E]'s unity and neutrality in the midst of the ongoing [war_in_heaven|E].\n\nThe exact nature of their failure in this final task in the years leading up to the [halakdun|E] is often pondered over by scholars interested in such esoteric topics. Most theories posit that the Mizfarun Dawl was itself finally overcome by the Wardenite-Ritualist factionalism, fracturing into competing orders of [magi|E] assassins. It is even theorized that these two newly splintered cults even had a hand in the [halakdun|E] itself, with the rival factions aiding and abetting their respective coreligionist allies in the Almadi and Alqarati cabals. A small minority - mocked even in the fringe circles of scholars with an interest in the topic - wildly claim that the Mizfarun Dawl never splintered, and in fact had engineered the [halakdun|E] and the continent spanning horror that followed for their own ends. Whether that was a genocidal attempt to bring a close to the [war_in_heaven|E] via mutual exhaustion of both parties, the side effects of an even more secret ritual meant to secure their ascension to a hitherto unknown spiritual plane, or something even more sinister still is something the doomsayers and conspiracists can never quite agree upon." #NT!

It was considered completely impregnable, not just because of its ingenious wards and defenses, but because it was also secreted away deep in the desert. No surviving accounts exist giving even the barest hint of its location or appearance, for it is believed that the masters of the Sirhad had magically bound shades to the task of hunting down and devour any written works which accurately described the fortress.\n\nThe Sunken house also protected much of the Sirhad's records, and was critical to maintaining their strong cohesion. While only a select few would be given the keys to access it, through a series of now lost spells the keepers of this citadel were able to stay in constant communication with the rest of the Sirhad, no matter how distant they were.\n\nThe House was yet another casualty of the collapse of the Sirhad, though thanks to a carefully maintained quarantine it is believed to have remained untouched by the Bloodblight. Instead, in the three days before all contact was lost, members of the Sirhad record having received a series of increasingly panicked and disoriented communiques from their contacts within the citadel, warning them from attempting to enter and raving about a shadowy animalistic hunter referred to only as "the Beast".\n\nDespite this somewhat ominous conclusion to its known history, finding and looting the Sunken House has been a perennial favorite of treasure hunters, adventurers, exiles and common bandits everywhere throughout Sarradon and beyond.
