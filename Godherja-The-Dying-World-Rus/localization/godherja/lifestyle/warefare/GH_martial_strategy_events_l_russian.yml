 martial_strategy.2001.elysian_pass.desc: "#F The scroll describes the Battle of the Elysian Pass. Cenware exploited the pride of the [aversarian|E] Legions and baited them into gathering the full force of the remaining southern legions in a valley before his numerically smaller force. After baiting the Legions to overextend, his [mixed_magi|E] unleashed never before seen magics upon the Legions, filling the valley with [fog|E]. The Aversarians panicked immediately, and Cenware's forces quickly charged into the disorganized mass as their commanders struggled to regain control. Out of the 26 legions that had marched to stop the Sjalvolki invasion, only 4 remained after the route south, along with only a hundred surviving [magi|E].#!" #NT!
 martial_strategy.2001.red_river_war.desc: "#F In the [red_river_war|E], the Marcher kingdoms sat divided in a period known as the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E]. The [lich_king|E] [silas_stavro|E] invaded south with the largest force of [gh_general_undead|E] seen in known memory. He reached further south than any [lich|E] to that point, exploiting the politicized and partisan [antimagi|E] orders who had dedicated themselves to various Marcher warlords. The remains of one of these orders, destroyed in the invasion, gathered together and began a journey across the Marcher realms and into [aversaria|E] to gather allies. After convincing the largest of the warlords to cease their fighting and assist them in stopping the invasion, they met the Lich army at [peti_gisredde|E], where they fought a final battle in the city. The battle ended when their leader, only known as the [champion_of_chevalie|E], fought [stavro|E] in one on one combat in the King of Gisredde's palace. While the Champion died in the battle, he destroyed the Lich, and the [gh_general_undead|E] army shattered soon after.#!" #NT!
 martial_strategy.2001.balaren_dispute.desc: "#F When Legon Theysalion of the 44th Legion attempted to annex the Konijkmener ports in the Balaren Dispute, it was expected to be an easy campaign. The Konijkmener guards numbered less than 500, while his gathered forces included that number in only [magi|E], along with thousands of legionarys. The only benefit the Konijkmener had was their massive fleet, which all assumed would be useless in what seemed to be a battle on land. Admiral Gurard however levied his sailors to dig a great moat before the port of Hoevasia while much of his fleet cut off [aversarian|E] reinforcements along the Thuul rivers. When Theysalion arrived, Gurard's fleet formed the 'Great Wood Wall' along the moat, where their deck based siege weaponry wreaked havoc among the invading legions. The fleet held Theysalion for four months, until he was ordered to commit suicide for the humiliation of failing to take the port, and the Aautokratir soon after declared a ceasefire.#!" #NT!
 martial_strategy.2001.the_broken_chain.desc: "#F As [sarradon|E] burned in the second century of nearly unstopped religious warfare in the Dread of Heavens, the Empire of Kemsar held the west in alliance with the Ritualist kingdoms. The Amsari toiled on their behalf, forging untold amounts of weapons and crafts for the Kemsari's massive army, which were regularly turned on the Amsari slaves in mass retribution for even the most minor of slights. The Amsari gathered every hundredth weapon in secret, and taught one another the powers of magic in shadow. Amassing their strength, they took the Wehydka'ha, the most powerful center of magic in the west, and used the power within to change the flow of the Heya river. Before the war between Amsari and Kemsari could even properly begin, the Kemsari empire collapsed in on itself, its fertile plains suddenly dry, and the Amsari soon formed a great empire while the Kemsari fell into an anarchy to last centuries. The taking of the Wehydka'ha would become known as the Battle of the Broken Chain, and is a holiday among Amsari to this day.#!" #NT!
