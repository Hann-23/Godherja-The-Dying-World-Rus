Yeru-mai once tried to slay her husband in a fit of jealousy, but was stopped by their eldest son Ölik at the cost of his life. Their second son Kaigan, covering his face at the sight, fled and swore to never build a home of earth or harvest its fruits. And from Kaigan's loins came all the peoples of the steppe." #NT!

 cumani_adherent_plural: "Öltenis" #NT!
 cumani_desc: "The Öltenis believe that if they leave their faces exposed for too long, jealous Yeru-mai will identify them as Kalgan's children and steal their souls away.

These masks are only removed during intimate or ritually important moments, as a sign of pure loyalty and vulnerability." #NT!
