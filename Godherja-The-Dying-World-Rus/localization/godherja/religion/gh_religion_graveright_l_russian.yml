 gravewatch_desc: "The Gravewardens are those that worship a modernized version of the Graveright, created in an attempt to ensure the Graveright's survival with the modern world. Instead of necropolis complexes where the dead are stored, and buildings made of their bones, the dead are watched over for a week as priests perform rituals of purification and rest. Gravewardens claim these rites will still allow the soul to protect an area as long as they continue their memory and build markers commemorating them in death. These grave sites are tightly guarded by temple guardians, each individual body looked over by a cadre of guards who ensure that they are not disturbed.\n\nWhile far more acceptable to modern eyes, it has struggled to find converts among the Marches or convince the old believers of their vision, and has struggled to take hold." #NT!
