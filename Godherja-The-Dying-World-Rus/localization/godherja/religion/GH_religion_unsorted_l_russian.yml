Sheticadders claim that the new stars fused with the dead gods essence, and that fate and prophecy could now be divined by studying them, Aethios' ancient divine will still twinkling in each one." #NT!

 kathanouxiac_desc: "While veneration of the '[Concept('magi','Wizard King')|E]' was never popular, Kathanouxa's insistence that he was the rightful god and ruler of [aeras|E] was frequently enforced at staff-point and gathered enough of a following over centuries of his rule for it to persist long after his death. Kathanouxiacians believe that Kathanouxa did not die but ascended, and use the mysterious term 'Wizard' for their priesthood in honor of him with hopes their dread master will spare them upon his return." #NT!

 odyrian_desc: "Odyrianism is the worship of the warlords Odyr Then, Odyr Lleth, and Odyr Hune. Rebels to the ancient Mountain-Sun Temple and then the proto-[aversarians|E], the Odyr's rose in 65, 87, and 109 respectively. To this day it is hotly debated whether the Odyr's were related, took the former's names out of respect, or if Odyr was some sort of ancient title from a single culture.\n\nRegardless, the Odyr's proved to be shrewd administrators and warriors both, each staging significant rebellions to whichever realm they lived under despite harsh retribution. Odyrians believe that the Odyr's were reincarnations of the ancient god Odyranon, and that one day a final 'Odyr Thorm' will rise and retake the throne of heaven to lead all peoples. While over a dozen false Odyr's have risen over the centuries since Odyr Hune, none have ever proven themselves worthy of the title." #NT!

Orphecian society placed high importance upon [magi|E] as representatives of the will of Orphecia's aspects, conclaves of Magi representing each aspect leading most Orphecian realms.\n\nThe most famous Orphecian realm was [the_imperium_of_kartharadd|E], which invaded [aversaria|E] during the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E] and conquered the province of Malcois, reaching as far as western Opakhasia before finally being stopped.

 mountain_sun_temple_desc: "'Followers' of the Mountain-Sun Temple, as they refer to themselves as, worship the mountain now referred to as the [GetBuilding('vounill_01').GetName]. Follower doctrine claims that there are twenty major gods and eighty spirits and demons, and their esoteric methods are far too complicated and intricate for anyone to understand unless they have dedicated themselves to studying them. Followers believe that nobody but one who understands them may rule, and historically the Mountain-Sun Temple was entirely ruled by a theocratic class of monastic orders, the chief one located at the [GetBuilding('vounill_01').GetName] itself.\n\nWhen the Mountain-Sun Temple, both the religion and the realm, were conquered by the [aversarians|E], many of their beliefs and structures were incorporated into their religion. Most notably, the Mountain-Sun Temple still technically exists as the 'Scarlet Chosen', an Aversarian order of warrior-monks protecting the [GetBuilding('vounill_01').GetName] temples." #NT!
