 sheharddi_religion_desc: "Those who keep the Sheharddi faith today often do so in secret. They refuse to accept any god other than Eloi, considering other deities to be misguided worship of #EMP Malikiyah#! at best and a trick of Eir'shaytan at worst. As a result, they have been ostracized and persecuted for centuries for refusing to participate in the worship of polytheistic pantheons." #NT!

 sheharddi_desc: "The origins of the sheharddi faith are shrouded in mystery, and scholars debate whether it is a syncretism of several [sarradonian|E] faiths, a single-god cult that split off from a larger polytheistic faith, or the surviving remnants of a more primordial religion. They believe that the high god Eloi, creator of the heavens, created a race called the Malikiyah, or Messengers. The eldest of these, Eir'Shaytan, created an even lesser race of beings - the humans - to be his servants and to worship him and his six lieutenants as if they were greater than their father. This caused mankind to be expelled from paradise after the [kalnaih|E] and only by being honorable and righteous in life can one return to heaven to worship Him for eternity." #NT!
