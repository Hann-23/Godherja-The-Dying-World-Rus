They exhort the divine attributes of dragonkind, and insist that the creator god, Karalthor created those known as the Winged Lords in their own image to rule over mankind as benevolent monarchs and vicious scourges of injustice and impurity. The greatest of the Winged Lords, Paratharian stands above all others as the firstborn child of Karalthor and overlord of not only all Dragons but of Aeras itself.

In spite of this, Biblos'xarians are notoriously devoted to their deity, often conducting elaborate ceremonies and libations for the purpose of honoring him.\n\nFrom an early age, children are educated by their elders of Bibloseia's travels and struggles in his journey to obtain the ultimate gift: evading death itself. According to the legend passed down through generations, a young Bibloseia was spoken to one night by the spirit Sautono, promising him that immortality would be his if he killed the frightening death-king Polas-Uro in combat. Sautono warned the young boy that this was a task he would need to devote his life to, for entire armies had groveled at the feet of Polas-Uro before.\n\nBut Bibloseia was a determined soul. Through many years of training, he became an inspiring warrior, wielding a spear and a unique nine-sided shield he crafted from the finest wood and metal on his home island. Cutting down enemies like a lumberjack topples trees, Bibloseia eventually became strong enough to challenge Polas-Uro, who had kept his strength even in age. And after a duel lasting five hours, Polas-Uro was impaled through the head; the death-king was himself slain.\n\nYet when Bibloseia called upon Sautono to give him immortality, the spirit laughed. Without warning, Bibloseia was instantly turned into stone and cast deep into the earth. The devilish Sautono had given Bibloseia immortality, but not in the way that he wished..." #NT!

Given to the worship of the mysterious god Tagognth, whose true name is privy to none save only the most highly ranking of their priestly strata, the Cultists of the Bitter Wave practice a set of exceptionally unsettling rituals they believe are required to commune with the strange god of the sea. The blood of man is a common component, though other strange materials such as unusual skulls that resemble a sister group of humanity are also used from time to time. How or where they obtain such skulls and other strange curiosities is unknown. Priests and laymen both don helmets and armor of a make similar to no other culture on [aeras|E], confounding scholars who question the purpose of such attire.

Life is short, and when one dies there is no lofty afterlife or place of heavenly residence but only the returning of one's body to the seasalt it was before.\n\nThus, one should seize any opportunities that might arise, commit any crimes one might wish to commit and take all that one can, for nothing lies beyond the veil of death besides an eternity of being carried from shore to shore by the perfidious sea that once troubled them so much in life. To kill is to exert one's will on this world of the damned and change the tides of fate themselves. To rule is to be strong, and the weak should stand aside or die when confronted by their betters. No law, no god, and no king constrains the Seaborne, who come where they will and go when they may, and woe betide any who seek to chain them." #NT!

The self-proclaimed Listeners of Thoronis are of the belief that the eponymous god Thoronis gave rise to the oceans in an expression of their rage against the denizens of the seafloor who refused to offer worship to them. To avert such tragedies from occurring again, adherents regularly make offerings in the form of immense ships bearing sacrifices to the sea to appease the god, who will in return give gifts such as calm seas and bountiful harvests. It is rumored that these sacrificial vessels sometimes bear humans in times of famine and stormy weather, when their god is thought to be greatly angered, although the existence of such practices is vehemently denied by Thoronites." #NT!

Originating from the few remnants of the legendary pirate's crew that managed to elude [aversarians|E] and Order Militant both, the Calystoans held fast to the beliefs of their freedom-loving patron, treasuring personal autonomy and liberty above all else. For this they are staunchly opposed to the heretical Saintly Order of Calysto's Key, whom they view as mere slavers and heretics of the most vile breed. Unlike most cults of the isles centered around exceptional heroic figures, Calystoanistism holds Calysto to be a deity who descended from the celestial realm to unite the lost peoples of [aeras|E] into one. Though he has now returned to his abode in the cosmos, it is believed that in this action he left the task of completing his holy work to humanity, a charge taken up by the Calystoans in their mission to break the bonds of servitude and bring about an era of complete freedom for all the people of Aeras." #NT!

Natural events, from light breezes to massive thunderstorms, are the gods' steps and moves, and the great cyclical patterns of nature are movements and tempos. Mortals are part of the dance too, though they do not understand the beats they follow in the way that the gods do.\n\nKidarian rituals unsurprisingly center around dancing. Whether to mimic a god's rhythm in thanks and praise, or to use their own rhythms in hope of influencing the world around them, Kidarian priests know a drumbeat for every prayer imaginable. They dedicate themselves in the name of Kidar-awah, the first man to learn the gods' rhythms, and strive to get a glimpse of the divine by dancing in the gods' steps in an endless frenzy. Unfortunately for them, it is more likely to result in bloodied feet and broken ankles than enlightenment." #NT!

In the shadow of death, the Fifth came to despise the Four, seeing the corruption of tainted blood that nearly saw the end of their people.\n\nThe Fifth preached to those who would listen of the Truth, a message of betrayal that saw his newfound followers send him to the ancient gods of old.

A final instruction followed that inspired a thousand years of followers, a request to go forth, sail the seas, and hear the calling for themselves.

 hero_religion_desc: "'Hero Cult' is a catch-all term for thousands of minor faiths tied together by a common belief system which places great mortals as the forefront object of worship, originating in the Western [Concept('shatteredisles','Isles')|E]. Though its legends may occasionally include mentions of disinterested deities and world-shaking leviathans, most Hero Cult pantheons are composed almost entirely of men and women of impressive deeds who are perceived to have some connection to local history - though this connection can often be quite tenuous, debatable or outright invented from whole cloth. Despite some propensity to exalt great warriors more often than heroes of other backgrounds, tales of the exploits of great adventurers, traders, scholars, rogues and [magi|E] are no less treasured than their more martial counterparts." #NT!

 deep_one_cult_desc: "The powers of the deep are myriad in their forms and cruelties, but it is to them that worship must be given, as their power is second to none. So it was taught to the Falamai of the [shatteredisles|E] by [hameh|E], the Viridescent Prophet. It was he who instructed mankind of the rituals needed to appease the ones below, after he himself delved into the dark waters and emerged a changed man.\n\nThe Falamai are notorious for slaying those they meet at sea, taking captive one man out of every ten, which they then use in a profane ritual that turns them into conduits for the Falamai to converse with the gods beneath. The Deep Ones are incomprehensible and maddening to mortals however, and even the briefest interaction with them results in changes to both the Speaker and the Listener's mind and body. Most of the messages received from the deep are gibberish, or spoken in tongues long forgotten — with the Speaker often dropping dead after conveying one or two messages. At times however, the instructions are clear, and speak of an approaching time when the Deep Ones will emerge to claim the world above." #NT!

 black_abyss_cult_desc: "Kidunawists believe in the Black Abyss, the Kidunawa, a second sea-beneath-the-sea home to the evil of the deep, demons and sinister deities that conspire against all life above water. The great storms of the [Concept('shatteredisles','Isles')|E] that swallow a village whole, the creatures of the deep pulling whaling ships that stray too far from shore; the calamities of the sea are understood as punishment from those below for a life devoid of respect for the deep.\n\nAdherents see appeasement as the only sane way to live, offering a seventh of their humble catch every time they return from sea. Life is lived low, small villages of respectful buildings, governed by an array of esoteric superstitions to ward off the evergazing eyes of the deep. The most devout followers are known to graft the remains of sea creatures to their bodies, for those who bear part of the deep need not fear the deep." #NT!

Each star is an ascended legend of old, each constellation a sign for their followers. Worship is what draws them back to the lands they once called home, the brighest stars are those still treasured by their followers on Aeras.
