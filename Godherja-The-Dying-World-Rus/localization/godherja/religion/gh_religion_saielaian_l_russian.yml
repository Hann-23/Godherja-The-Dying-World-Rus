 bayn_huac_desc: "A faith found in the long-conquered but ever restive territory of Saielai, Bayn Huac Driem is fundamentally a form of matriarchal ancestor worship. Adherents are expected to keep shrines honoring the lineage of their mothers and grandmothers, with wealthier patrons being expected to produce more elaborate offerings. In particular, lifelike portraiture and sculpture are held in high esteem, and has resulted in the Saielai producing some of the east's most renowned portrait artists and sculptors. Their best work, of course, has always gone towards honoring their mothers' shrines." #NT!
