 ahridar_desc: "The strange and somewhat mysterious beliefs of the tribes of the western crater, Ahridar is the worship of the ancient god-king Ohrasik, who freed humanity from slavery at the hands ancient devils who once filled the world with shadow. Ohrasik slew the devils and enslaved many of them to follow his will, but the scars the devils left on the world never went away, becoming shadow and night and resisting Ohrasik who would take the form of the sun in the sky. Ahridarists maintain that Ohrasik is an extremely active god despite the silence he gives his faithful, Ohrasik simply so focused on his daily war against shadow that he is unable to answer the majority of the prayers of the faithful.\n\nMany Ahridarist warlords have claimed to be [malaak|E], or Ohrasik incarnate, Ahridarists claiming that Ohrasik will sometimes assist his faithful by taking human form and working to slay the servants of darkness. Most rulers who claim this title proclaim "It is I who will slay the moon" upon their proclamation, believing [aervalr|E] to be the evil god who directs the devils against Ohrasik.\n\nAversarian scholars have noted that the Ahridarist oral tradition seems to reference multiple events that did not actually occur anywhere near the crater, but in ancient [aversaria|E]. Despite this, no further link has anyone been found, and the faith has remained an exceptionally interesting topic in Aversarian scholarly circles, though is far too remote and removed from Aversarian affairs for serious notice to be spared." #NT!

 arayvtar_desc: "Arising from ancient interactions with the [wardenites|E], the Arayvtar hold that the Warden and several prominent [mamur|E]s in the Wardenite religion were, in fact, [malaak|E]s carrying out the will of Ohrasik. As such, the Arayvtar have adopted some of the teachings of the Warden, claiming that the moon is the prison that contains the dead god, and that the correct traditions and laws must be observed to keep it trapped there." #NT!
