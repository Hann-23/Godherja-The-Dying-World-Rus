Since we have a good translation in our possession we should assemble a team to decode this masterwork and try to squeeze yet more secrets of [dead_magic|E] from its pages. We should be wary however, for the tome is known to contain numerous "trap" rituals meant to trick and kill unskilled decipherers. Cost is another issue, as the process will consume numerous man hours and a veritable mountain of reagents." #NT!
