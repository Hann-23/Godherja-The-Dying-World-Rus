Then there is the stream of the Tillyes valley, in which flows a strange liquid. The locals say that during dry episodes, it becomes almost milky in aspect. One can drink it, cook with it, though it has a somewhat pungent taste but thankfully no smell. Knowing the river originates from the land of the dead, one can wonder what substance this is.\n\nStill, Graverights as well as Gravewards come together in enjoying the fruits of the admittedly queer local orchard.
