I take first watch through the night, staring at our campfire as it turns to a handful of dying embers. As I lay there, listening to the fire's crackle, a soft bubbling begins to rise from the edge of the pond. In a panic, I quickly rise, readying my weapon. The moonlight does not penetrate the surface of the water, but I notice it bubbling and splashing into the soil. My companions have not noticed in their slumber, and I slowly step closer to the water. Strangely, I feel almost drawn to it. Bubbles and foam give way to nostrils and eyelids, lips and cheekbones - a face in the water.\n\nIts skin seems almost translucent, and the soft light of the night sky makes it glow in the water. I cannot help but stumble backwards at the sight, and am unable to grip my weapon as I shake uncontrollably. The milky eyelids snap open, and the pale, white irises of this face stare deep into mine, as if searching for something within. Its lips curl into a half smile.

Several of my party members wretch, and one actually vomits.\n\nWhat used to be a significant portion of our supplies has rotted away so thoroughly that some of it has outright turned to pus, and large maggots have begun crawling out.
