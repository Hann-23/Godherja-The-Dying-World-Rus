No, here we follow only the strong and if I am to ensure my realm does not break apart, I must demonstrate that strength.\n\n#N If you do not have at least 15 martial and level 3 fame in 5 years, your realm will shatter via your vassals becoming independent, though you will also gain claims on their lands if you should wish to seek revenge.
