 clique.0005.t: "An Open Post" #NT!
 clique.0005.desc: "I have been informed of most tragic happenings within our fine organization, the death of [previous_holder_character.GetTitledFirstName], one of our highly ranking members, which is at once both a great blow and great opportunity. With their death comes the chance to appoint a new and more loyal officeholder for the good of myself and my own political faction. However, I must tread carefully here, for the mere veneer of being overly prejudiced could undermine instead of strengthening us.\n\nI must also take into consideration that any promises made in the previous occupant's lifetime as to the selection best be kept, for it would reflect poorly upon me to not do so. I, [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName], will ultimately decide here, for better or worse." #NT!
 clique.0005.a: "A new officeholder from [previous_holder_character.GetFirstName]'s faction is liable to keep the peace." #NT!
 clique.0005.b: "While it may anger some, an associate of my faction is most fit here." #NT!
 clique.0005.c: "Let the members therein make their own choices, for I have no wish to interfere." #NT!
 clique.0005.d: "The post must fall to me, though many will decry me for this seeming abuse of power." #NT!
 clique.0005.e: "I am no oathbreaker, and will hold to my previous agreements to appoint [clique_appointed_heir.GetFirstName]." #NT!
