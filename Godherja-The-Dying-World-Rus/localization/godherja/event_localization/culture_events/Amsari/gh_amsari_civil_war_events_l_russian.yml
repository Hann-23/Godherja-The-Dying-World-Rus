 opening_event_sarradon.2.desc: "Qanamsar Pejman has reigned for seventy years, Seventy one now that another Longest Night has passed and ushered in the new year. He is a good man, and a just ruler. Certainly wiser than some who have ruled in his place before, and some who could have done so in his stead - on this fact everyone in the Hiklahn can agree.\n\nIt must, however, be admitted that there may have been some serious lapses in judgement on his part.\n\nHis forefathers did not hesitate to see the line pruned of pretenders before their death. A brutal task to be sure, and not one which I envy, but history has proven it a necessity for the good of the Hiklahn. Pejman, however, is a good, and kind man. He has compassion for a world which is often so quick to punish the compassionate. For his virtue he may have doomed us to the fires of a full civil war, a horror not seen for generations.\n\nBut these are concerns for another time. Pejman slows with age, but he has lived for ninety years and is sure to live for at least few more. So for the time being, the chroniclers shall likely mark this year as another year of little consequence in the Hiklahn." #NT!

 amsari.0002.desc: "My father, Pejman, is dead. Of this I am certain. A horse messenger from the palace arrived yesterday bearing the news, but word reached the public at large less than a day later from the mouths of riverboat sailors and merchants. I am also certain that my brothers will be marshaling their forces, preparing to take the vacant throne by force. Though our father urged us all to peacefully accept only the eldest among us as our leader, I know many - most, perhaps - of my brothers have no intention of following this directive. And so I am left with a choice. Do I march? Or do I try to stay out of the war to come." #NT!

The Princes have been plotting against one another for years, this was an open secret, but everyone ignored that this day would come.\n\nNow my mind prickles with the idea of my own Empire...do I have the strengh to claim the Hiklahn as my own?

Those princes who wisely chose to refrain from taking up arms against me have again chosen wisely and now swear fealty to me as their rightful liege, though it would be wise for me to keep a close watch on their ambitions.\n\nAs I stand in the palace of my ancestors contemplating where to go from here, I can hear the wailing of women from the streets outside heralding yet another funeral. The Civil War has taken a heavy toll upon the Amsari, and it will take many years for us to recover. But we have risen from worse tragedies. There is naught that fate can inflict upon a people such as us, who have risen from abject slavery to mastery of the greatest Empire on Aeras, that we are not sure to overcome." #NT!

Devils shall cavort upon the burnt earth, and foul magics will wrack your children's forms.

Our homeland, the birthright granted to us by the Prophet himself and won for us by the suffering of our ancestors, it bleeds! [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName] forgive us for what we have squandered. Fifty long years this conflict has raged - an unprecedented occurrence in the Hiklahn. We have had civil wars aplenty, but nothing like this! An entire generation who have never known unity now reach middle age, and only a handful of elders yet remain who have clear memories of the time before the shattering of the Amsari people.\n\nPerhaps this is not the end of the Hiklahn. Perhaps one day another shall come to reunite our squabbling people, and bring order where there is now only chaos. But for now, the throne of the Qanamsars is naught but a thing of memory.
