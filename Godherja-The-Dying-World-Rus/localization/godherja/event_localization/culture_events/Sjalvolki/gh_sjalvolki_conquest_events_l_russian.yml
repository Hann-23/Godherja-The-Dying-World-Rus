 #sjalvolki_conquest.0120.desc: "As I join my men in roaming the countryside of Aversaria, we come across a great manor. At its sides are large fields of grain, wine vineyards, and olive trees. I recognize it as a plantation, where the Aversarians work their slaves to death. Likely spurred on by rumors of my approach, some of the slaves have taken up arms against the enforcers tasked with watching them in the fields. A slave spots me as I come closer to get a better look. Desperate, he calls out for help before an Aversarian curses, "Subhuman scum!", and swings his blade. The slave lets out a cry as he is cut down. Beside him, a few slaves pick up rocks and use their numbers to get the advantage on the distracted Aversarian and bash in his skull. Without my help, both sides will tear each other to shreds, leaving everything free for the taking. The loot from a manor like this normally always requires the sacrifice of lives, and better the lives of a few slaves than my men. However, looking into the eyes of the fallen slave who called out to me, I remember the Sjavolki teachings. We are the stewards of the world, we were sent by the gods to destroy evil." #NT!

They now kneel before me, hands bound, speaking in broken [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName]. 'P-please, spare me. I am [aversarian_magi.GetName]. I can serve you, great lord. I have great power.' Tears are beginning to run down [aversarian_magi.GetHerHis] face as [aversarian_magi.GetSheHe] looks up at me. [aversarian_magi.GetHerHis|U] offer is, at first, tempting, with Aversarian magi being famed for their power. However, [aversarian_magi.GetSheHe] was caught while resisting my troops and perhaps deserves execution instead. Of course, I could always spare [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim], but leave [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim] powerless, surely a punishment that would make any Aversarian weep." #NT!

 sjalvolki_conquest.0146.desc: "As my troops storm over the walls, the defenders fleeing before us, my troops begin to greedily eye everything they see. Slowly at first, and then in larger groups as more and more enemies fall, soldiers begin to break ranks, brandishing weapons as they run through the streets to the screams of the city's inhabitants. I see one of my troops kick open a door and cut down the people sheltering behind it, as another begins stripping the possessions of a cowering merchant. By the time the final defenders have been killed, order is beginning to break down in the streets. As a torch is raised to what appears to be a wealthy man's home, and ignites the building, I realize that I have to do something. The troops will love me if I let them plunder as they wish, but I also run the risk of completely losing control of them." #NT!

The burnt-out shells of buildings mark where people once lived their lives. Soldiers slumber in random places, all order having broken down in the sack. As I step over a corpse, I see two of my followers engaged in a duel, seemingly fighting over a pouch of gold stolen from one of the city's former inhabitants. Victory has been achieved, however this settlement is now effectively useless to us. The few refugees will surely spread tales of how we are every bit the barbarians they believe us to be, and it will take some time to whip the soldiers back into shape." #NT!
