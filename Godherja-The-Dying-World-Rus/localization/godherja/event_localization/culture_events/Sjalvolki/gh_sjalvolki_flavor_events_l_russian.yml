 sjalvolki_monthly.1000.desc: "Mighty [velos|E] granted us the knowledge to hunt, and gave us lordship over the beasts of the world to sate our hunger. Though his gift is great, we must be careful that it is not squandered.\n\nA recent dispute has emerged between two of our clans in [sjalvolki_province_dispute.GetName] over how the land will be used. One clan leans towards traditional hunting and intend to leave the undeveloped territory wild in order to continue taking game there. The other are dedicated agriculturalists, and have intentions of clearing a portion of the territory for more farmland. While the hunters' claim has the weight of the pious cult of Velos behind it, both sides have valid arguments, so it passes to me to determine how exactly the land should be stewarded." #NT!

 sjalvolki_monthly.1001.desc: "It has long been held as sacred tradition that any beast a hunter slays is theirs to do with as they please - [velos|E] promised us no less. However, anything a hunter finds that is not an animal falls under secular legal codes. Today several hunters, as is demanded of them by law, return with news of a dilapidated ruin deep in the forests of my [sjalvolki_hunters_find.GetName]. Fearing ghosts and spirits, the superstitious party did not investigate further. Since the ruin lies in my domain I can do with this information as I wish. Of course, if I have them lead me back to it they will be owed a small fee." #NT!

 sjalvolki_monthly.1002.desc: "Our small party makes its way through the dense wilderness of [sjalvolki_hunters_find.GetName], taking the better part of the day to reach the ruins. After setting up camp I poke my head inside. Despite the trepidation of my guides I see no ghosts or spirits here, just the ruins of [aversarian|E] decadence. This estate seems to have once been a plantation of sorts, but the wilds managed to almost completely overtake it after just a few generations of abandonment. Hacking my way through the dense vines overgrowing what was once a doorway, I find myself in the crumbling remains of a library. To my disappointment, little remains of the books but sodden heaps of rot. Just when I am about to give up, something catches my eye." #NT!

 sjalvolki_monthly.1003.desc: "Our small party makes its way through the dense wilderness of [sjalvolki_hunters_find.GetName], taking the better part of the day to reach the ruins. The building is squat and sturdy, constructed from roughly hewn stones. It's clear that this was likely once a fort or garrison of some kind, and the carving of the Purest above the doorway gives clear indication of the nationality of those who once manned it. Shouldering the heavy door open, I survey the ruin inside. The remnants of an armory are scattered across the interior, but of the arms and armor once stored here little more is left than scraps of rust. After a few hours of searching, however, my men and I are able to find a tightly sealed chest that must have been overlooked. After breaking it open we find, wrapped in oiled cloth and sealed away from the elements..." #NT!

 sjalvolki_monthly.1004.desc: "Our small party makes its way through the dense wilderness of [sjalvolki_hunters_find.GetName], taking the better part of the day to reach the ruins. It turns out to be a small complex, evidently once a network of mills, abandoned some time after the world was broken. While the village that must have once surrounded this place has been fully devoured by the wild, the mill itself is in remarkably good condition. While many of the metal implements will need to be replaced, our craftsmen could study the mechanisms and replicate the sophisticated design. Alternatively, the lumber and whatever survives of the machinery would fetch a fine price, though it would upset the locals." #NT!

It quickly becomes clear that this structure once served as an Aversarian Náon - a temple of our old adversaries. The faded iconography of the Purest still adorns this structure, and the interior seems to have been abandoned in great haste, for the various implements of faith were not taken with the Omitilos who once manned this place. Whatever village or community this building once serviced is unclear, but it's now in our hands." #NT!

The structure standing before us was clearly once an [aversarian|E] estate of some kind, centered around a now abandoned villa. Pushing into the rotted structure we encounter a strange sight. Enigmatic pieces of metal lie scattered about the rooms of the partially collapsed building, copper feathers heavy with verdigris lie everywhere, and the ruined remnants of what appear to have been statues of wild cats and other beasts slump in corners, little more than heaps of rust. At the center of it all sits the skeletal remains of what I presume to have been the estate's deranged owner, greedily cradling a bundle of unrecognizable gears. Lord and master over a menagerie as lifeless as he.\n\nAfter a full day of searching this strange tomb, my team and I discover..." #NT!

Yet, [guardian.GetName] has yet to teach me to shoot even a rabbit. Perhaps I should pester [guardian.GetHerHim] to take me out hunting and show me the ropes so my friends will stop teasing me about never having gone hunting.
