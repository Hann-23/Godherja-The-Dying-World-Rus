 marcher_political.0001.desc: "As my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('previous_chevalie_ruler'))]'s lifeless body is burned away by the pyre, my mind is heavy with worries. It is no secret that many in Chevalie have been waiting with sheathed daggers for this moment, for every time a [previous_chevalie_ruler.GetTitleTierName] passes, opportunities are ripe for snakes to seize power.\n\nAlready, whispers are pouring in of plotting nobles and their pet pretenders making plans for rebellion out in the countryside. My court is unusually empty as well, as many have fled to their estates to prepare for the coming civil war.\n\nIn the coming days, rebels will appear like toadstools. I should begin mustering my armies and preparing for the inevitable." #NT!

 marcher_political.0004.desc: "Expectedly, not all were content to sit on their laurels and pass up the opportunity to push their claim to the throne. Word has already reached me that [first_pretender.GetFirstName] has been proclaimed [first_pretender.GetTitleTierName] in [first_pretender.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier], but [first_pretender.GetSheHe] is sure to be followed by more.\n\nThe following days are sure to prove hectic as the first battles of the coming conflict are fought. I can only hope that my newfound foes will break their heads against each other, rather than focusing on me." #NT!

None were able to stand before their advances, until now.\n\n[attacker.GetTitledfirstName] has begun the call, and brave Marchers from across Chevalie have begun to flock to their banner in defense of our land. As the armies of Chevalie begin their march, messengers have arrived across the land, inviting all to defend what's rightfully ours." #NT!
