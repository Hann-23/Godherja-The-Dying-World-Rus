 colonization_event.0001.desc: "The colony at [county_being_colonized.GetName] has reported record prosperity. Poring over the records my steward handed me, its success has encouraged scores of new settlers to arrive, greatly increasing the number and size of settlements throughout the region.

 colonization_event.0001.b: "Levy a small 'prosperity tax' on them." #NT!

 colonization_event.0011.desc: "Magistrates in charge of the colony of [county_being_colonized.GetName] report that it is plagued by a veritable horde of brigands formed from disaffected settlers. They assault vital caravans, pillage undefended settlements, and wreak havoc in general on the land. As I'm reading the multitude of reports, my marshal awaits my command." #NT!
 colonization_event.0011.a: "We can do nothing for the colony." #NT!
 colonization_event.0011.b: "Send them gold and weapons so they can defend themselves." #NT!

 colonization_event.0021.a: "They will have to fend for themselves." #NT!
 colonization_event.0021.b: "Send them enough food to survive the year." #NT!

 colonization_event.0031.t: "Incompetent Administrator" #NT!
 colonization_event.0031.desc: "My steward has found that the official in charge of the colony at [county_being_colonized.GetName] has severely mismanaged the colony, founding new settlements in poor regions, placing farms in inhospitable areas, and improperly storing perishable goods. This level of stupidity is criminal, and the administrator has been arrested and brought before me for judgement." #NT!

 colonization_event.0041.desc: "The people of the colony at [county_being_colonized.GetName] have sent me a petition asking for aid. The colony has apparently been suffering from large populations of monsters predating on livestock and, in some cases, people. People are afraid to leave their homesteads, and trade between settlements is conducted only in large numbers. While some are hunting the beasts, not enough are volunteering for the dangerous work. Something must be done about this." #NT!
 colonization_event.0041.a: "I can't do anything about this." #NT!
 colonization_event.0041.b: "I will post a large bounty on these beasts." #NT!

 colonization_event.0061.desc: "My steward reports that the colony of [county_being_colonized.GetName] has seen an influx of new settlers, heading there for the promise of a bright future away from the homeland.

 colonization_event.0071.t: "Good Harvest" #NT!
 colonization_event.0071.desc: "The colony of [county_being_colonized.GetName] has enjoyed an unusually good harvest this year, my steward reports. Crops are blooming, and they will have more than enough food to feed themselves for this year and the next.

 colonization_event.0071.a: "Let them keep their grain; I don't need it." #NT!
 colonization_event.0071.b: "I'll seize a small amount of grain for my own ends." #NT!
 colonization_event.0071.c: "Take a tenth-share of the grain! I need it more than they do." #NT!

 colonization_event.0200.t: "To Build a Colony" #NT!
 colonization_event.0200.desc: "The colony of [county_being_colonized.GetName] has finally reached a state of financial independence. Where once was naught the province now enjoys the sounds of laughing children and the proud sweat of their brow[SelectLocalization(GetPlayer.HasTrait(GetTrait('greedy').Self),' and most important of all, the joy of paying their taxes!','.')] However this humble village will doubtless soon grow into a larger settlement of the type townships much like it shall circle, and it is up to me to decide what exactly that settlement shall one day look like." #NT!
 colonization_event.0200.a: "A fort shall be erected, to protect these lands." #NT!
 colonization_event.0200.b: "Let the people invest in commerce, and thus invest in the realm." #NT!
 colonization_event.0200.c: "Let this holding be one of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]." #NT!
