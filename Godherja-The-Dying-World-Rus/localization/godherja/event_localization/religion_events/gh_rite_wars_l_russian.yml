 sjalvolki_reformation.0011.desc: "The famed preacher, [sjalvolki_reformer.GetFullNameNicknamed] has, after having swayed nearly every noble in my court, finally appeared before my throne. Despite his disheveled appearance, his influence among both the nobility and peasantry alike means I have to at least hear him out.\n\nHe introduces himself briefly before entering into his request. According to this preacher, the Sjalvolki realms will fall to infighting over petty differences and the faith will be subsumed by the more organized religions that live in our midst. They ask for assistance in recording the various Sjalvolki beliefs throughout my realm to compile in a book that will guide followers to salvation in the final war. He states that, although his mission is going along well, he is limited by the fact that he is only a single man. My aid would be incredibly useful for his cause.\n\nMy choices are simple. I can choose to banish him from the realm, hopefully curtailing his influence. Doing nothing—allowing him to say his piece before moving on—is likely the least risky option, however might also allow his faith to take root. His ideas do sound interesting, such as centralization perhaps allowing me to improve my realm. Though it would be risky, I could also try to capture and execute him, though the death of holy men has an unfortunate tendency to create more of them." #NT!

 sjalvolki_reformation.0012.desc: "A group of shamans burst into my court proselytizing the words of the Preacher. They are a diverse lot, young and old, hailing from different corners of the Sjalvolki homeland. However, they all share a fire in their eyes that I cannot ignore.\n\nThey warn that a new world has formed, and the Sjalvolki must change with it. Without an organizational structure of the faith, they state, the Sjalvolki realms will fall to infighting over petty differences and the faith will be subsumed by the more organized religions that live in our midst. They ask for assistance in recording the various Sjalvolki beliefs throughout my realm to compile in a book that will guide followers to salvation in the final war. Then, they hand me a tome of their efforts so far. As I assess their writing, I realize that it is not just a collection, but a merging of different tales into a single, comprehensive narrative.\n\nThey state that if the Preacher's efforts take root, the Sjalvolki faith will no longer be disparate. Followers will still be able to continue their old ways while knowing they have the same beliefs as a Sjalvolki thousands of miles away. The new faith needs the realm's shamans to chronicle their own stories and to spread the word." #NT!

And yet, it is still shocking when a priest presents himself at my court, claiming that he has been chosen by the a group of high priests to guide the Sjalvolki in their time of crisis, as evidenced by the struggling unity of the faith. In a self-righteous tone, he explains that I must accept his authority as the Veloschosen, and aid him in bringing the decentralized chaos that has arisen since the death of the Preacher. He is backed by the ailing remnants of several of the ancient stewards of the Sjalvolki faith, having survived the [migrations|E] and, at least supposedly, maintained spiritual authority.\n\nHowever, there is another possibility. His authority is based, in effect, on self-proclamation, as he is the chosen leader of a self-declared high priesthood. Other theologians have also presented their thoughts to me, suggesting that perhaps it is the High King that we must look towards for an example. They claim that the triumphs of the Imperrech prove that the Sjalvolki need a strong leader to guide them into the future. Were I to accept this, it would certainly be controversial, for the Imperrech is understood to have dissolved with the Witch-Breaker's death. However, the scholars highlight, some of his recorded statements suggest that it was never truly meant to be unique, and that by becoming something which they describe as a Holy King, and leading the followers of [velos|E] into a new age of glory, I would merely be fulfilling Cenware's intentions.\n\nWhatever I choose, it is likely that another ruler will claim the mantle I deny, so I must be ready to uphold the faith, whatever may come." #NT!

As their spiritual authority descends from priesthoods centered on the Velosgrave, within the ancient homeland of our people, their seizure of power is merely setting the order of the faithful straight.\n\nOn the other hand, the supporters of the self-styled "Holy King" claim that a series of statements made by the late Cenware prove that the Imperrech was always meant as an example for the Sjalvolki, and that the declaration of the Holy Kingdom is merely fulfilling Cenware's wishes.\n\nHowever valid their arguments, the choice, it seems, is up to me." #NT!
