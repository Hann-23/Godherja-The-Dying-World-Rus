 sophocos_quest.5001.desc: "Finally, I have arrived at Blessed [GetBuilding('sophocos_01').GetName], the birthplace of the faith and the most sacred place on [aeras|E]; its one thousand and one steps stand defiantly, a lance thrust from base earth into the heavens. Pilgrims huddle in its cyclopean shadow, a gaggle of men and women from all walks of life and bearing the ritual signs of a hundred different cults. Some make preparations for their ascent, loading doomed pack mules with as many rations as the poor animals can carry, while other hawk wares to those departing and arriving.\n\nThe immense bulk of the tower looms over a sprawl of temples and pilgrim's inns. For those of greater means and lesser piety crude rope pulleys have been fashioned on some of the upper stairs, granting a shortcut to several hundred feet of enlightenment for a price in coin. Beyond that however the rich will have to ascend just like the poor: scrambling up steps twice the height of a man and hauling up after them whatever panicked pack animals they had the means to bring with them. Each stair is said to bring its own challenge to test and reward the faithful — though most are just empty.\n\nLaying my hand against the sun-warmed side of the tower's base I mull over the choices which lie before me.  I decide to..." #NT!

I have followed this ghost feverishly for hours, and its breakneck pace has not let up even once.\n\nToo exhausted to stand, I fall to my knees.

It's said that every pilgrim experiences something different and magnificent when reaching the pinnacle of the tower, but all I see here is the scattered detritus, shrines, and mummified corpses left by over a thousand years worth of pilgrimages. From this vantage point all of Sarradon stretches out below me, with the jutting curve of the Kharadamat peninsula clearly visible, as is the sea beyond it.\n\nTaking a deep breath of the crisp, almost painfully cold air, I must admit I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of astounding spiritual revelation, but at least I can now say that I've performed a feat impossible for many, and survived the ordeal. The angels, however, fail to make their appearance." #NT!
 sophocos_quest.6001.desc.zealous: "After many trials and tribulations, my companions and I finally achieve the summit. Here, so close to the heavens, I am struck dumb by the majesty, caught between the immensity which now sprawls around me, and the dazzling blaze of the sun above me. Overcome by the immensity of it all I suddenly feel short of breath, and drop to my knees as I am struck with a sudden and overwhelming sense of vertigo. Tiny pinpricks of light begin to blaze in the periphery of my vision and I realize that the Angels must be upon me. By [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] it's really happening!\n\n Alas, after a few moments the experience passes with no further phenomena. My faith it seems is not yet strong enough.\n\nI shall endeavor to be better when next I return." #NT!

From this vantage point all of Sarradon stretches out below me, with the jutting curve of the Kharadamat peninsula clearly visible, as is the even more distant sea beyond it.\n\nTaking a deep breath of the crisp and painfully cold air, I can't help but feel pride for my accomplishment.

Most of the Ritualist visitors fled well in advance when they saw the glow of heated brands and torches on the horizon, and only the handful of fools and fanatics who refuse to flee are left to burn alive inside the temples, pilgrim inns, and sacred chantries they dedicated their lives to maintaining. By the time the ring of fire burns to embers the following morning we've really set to work, looting shrines and toppling statues. Relic pits are filled in to dissuade magpies and vermin from sniffing around for treasure. An unlucky or unobservant caravan crests the hill only to be sacked, its unfortunate itinerants put to the sword\n\nI don't think the Ritualists will be coming back here for a long time.

Though the tower itself may be impregnable, the considerable infrastructure built over the years by intrepid pilgrims is not, and countless shrines and other holy places were put to the torch.

While the site is known to be of special importance to Ritualists it holds a special place for most faiths on Sarradon, and is one of the few locations where the [war_in_heaven|E] has abated in favor of an uneasy truce. Evidently for [sophocos_razer.GetFirstNameRegnal], this interfaith peace is not to [sophocos_razer.GetHerHis] liking. Though the tower itself may be indestructible, the veritable city built over the years by intrepid pilgrims is not, and countless shrines and other holy places were razed to the ground. Ritualists across Sarradon are already baying for blood, and even our own people are uneasy about the ramifications of this ill-omened act of unprovoked violence against the holiest place on our continent.

Whereas even the most heathenish kings are known to respect wisdom and virtue, [sophocos_razer.GetFirstName] has butchered the holy men and women residing there and put torch to their shrines. Though the holy tower itself is proof against the violence of any man on [aeras|E] naught else remains at its base, and we will surely be prevented from accessing it to seek wisdom.
