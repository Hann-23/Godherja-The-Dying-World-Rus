 the_pillars_of_virtue_name: "The Pillars of Virtue" #NT!
 the_pillars_of_virtue_desc: "There is enough literature concerning [wardenite|E] law that reading all of it would take even a dedicated student a lifetime to finish. Fortunately, the five works of the [first_warden|E] that form the bedrock of the entire faith — the Three Fathers, Visions and Marginalia — are an uncontroversial starting point for any acolyte's legal studies.\n\nI begin with the First Warden's first and most widely read work, the Pillars lay down much of the foundational work of Wardenite doctrine - the Dead God, the Pillars of Virtue, and several of the most basic of moral imperatives of the faith. Luckily for me, it is also considered the most readable of the five canonical works." #NT!
 the_book_of_days_name: "The Book of Days" #NT!
 the_book_of_days_desc: "I continue to advance in my legal studies. Under advisement from some of the magistrates in my court I have acquired a copy of The Book of Days, the third and longest of the so called "Three Fathers".\n\nThe Book of Days is widely regarded as the driest of the [first_warden|E]'s books, and their time studying it is usually viewed with trepidation by most burgeoning legal scholars. The book covers all manner of minutiae in a stilted and awkward style, attempting to cover every possible loophole or exception to the laws and ideas laid out in the First Warden's other texts. Most notorious of all is the massive final half of the book which gives an in-depth guide to all things relating to property, inheritance, and land taxation. Truly a riveting work." #NT!
 the_marginalia_name: "The Marginalia" #NT!
 the_marginalia_desc: "Now I move beyond the Three Fathers, onto the Marginalia. Condensed from roughly a dozen smaller works authored by the [first_warden|E] and compiled at the hands of the early [Concept('mamur','Mamurs')|E], the fifth of the Canonical works is also the most controversial. Radical sects often coalesce around obscure texts which they claim were also written by the Father of Our Laws, but purposefully excluded from the Canonical Works by the machinations of wicked scholars or Ritualists.\n\nThe somewhat eclectic texts covers a range of topics, and can be very difficult for students to master. On the other side, its ramshackle nature means that there's something in it for almost any kind of reader. From frank discussions of military logistics to poetic retellings of the First Warden's lesser visions, the Marginalia truly contains multitudes." #NT!
 the_visions_name: "The Visions" #NT!
 the_visions_desc: "Now I move beyond the Three Fathers, onto the Visions of the [first_warden|E]. Considered to be of only marginal legal importance by more conservative scholars, the Visions lays out the core ideological basis of our faith. While the books of laws tell us how to live and rule, the Visions of the First Warden lays out, in vivid and somewhat disturbing detail, why we do these things.\n\nOf course, not all scholars dismiss the tome as an ideological or poetic work. Many metaphoralists have come to the conclusion that the passages contain double meanings which, when analyzed by trained scholars, can give valuable new insights into the law." #NT!

The book is considered the second of the "Three Fathers", and an important milestone in any burgeoning legal scholar's education.\n\nThe Records is more or less exactly as it sounds - a study of the cases which passed through the First Warden's court over a period of roughly five years, though modern scholars bicker whether these cover every single case that the Father of our Laws presided over, or just the ones he considered most valuable to record. To a scholarly minded individual, the Records are something of a page turner, filled with demonstrable examples of [wardenite|E] law in action." #NT!
