 wardenite_decisions.0002.desc: "At the time of the [Concept('saints_war','Saint's Crusade')|E], the [wardenite|E] faith seemed doomed. The cursed [Concept('aversarians','Afazariani')|E] took many strongholds we thought impregnable, and persecuted and murdered the faithful, though their victims only ever wished to live justly and rightly. Many who should have known better claimed that the Final Confrontation was at hand, and that the Dead God would break free - a fitting punishment for our failure.\n\nAs we stand astride [sarradon|E] these days seem distant now. Even noble [tathtali|E] never held dominion over so much of Sarradon" #NT!
