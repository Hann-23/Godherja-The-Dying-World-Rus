 philantrianist.0011.t: "A Solicitation of Alms" #NT!
 philantrianist.0011.intro.philantrianist: "I have sent orders to the Collectors to gather alms by any means necessary, for the good of the order and those unfortunates we must provide for. Although the Collectors are derided as thugs and brutes by some of the natives, this is simply unfounded. In fact, the Collectors are incredibly tender and gentle to their most valuable possessions, leaving not even a scratch upon them. By Philantros, they even do them the courtesy of safekeeping their belongings for them until we have convinced them to donate to the order!\n\nPerhaps it is true they can get boisterous, but what of it? It is only because of their zeal for helping those less fortunate! There they go now, in green armor and carrying cudgels and maces to persuade the townspeople to make a contribution." #NT!
 philantrianist.0011.intro.non_philantrianist: "I have allowed the Collectors of the Order of the Golden Hand access to one of my towns, where they are free to collect 'donations' from the townsfolk for the next few days. In exchange for my generosity, I will receive a rather sizeable portion of the proceeds myself. If the locals are fortunate enough to be unfamiliar with the Kleptiakos and their methods, they will have lost that privilege very soon.\n\nIn any case, this is hardly my problem. [clique_member_scope.GetFirstName], the [clique_member_scope.Custom('GetHolyOrderBrotherOrSister')] assigned to this particular group of Philantrosianites, salutes me before making [clique_member_scope.GetHerHis] entry into the settlement." #NT!

 philantrianist.0012.t: "A Solicitation of Alms" #NT!
 philantrianist.0012.intro.kleptiakos: "As a devout of the Philantrosianites and a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetHolyOrderBrotherOrSister')] of the Collectors, I am within my rights to set out and collect alms on my own accord. I have a rather large amount of leeway on how, exactly, I will go about approaching this task." #NT!
 philantrianist.0012.intro.non_kleptiakos: "As a devout of the Philantrosianites and a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetHolyOrderBrotherOrSister')] of the Collectors, the order has commanded me to aid [interaction_requester.GetTitledFirstName] in collecting alms for the needy in territory under [interaction_requester.GetHerHis] jurisdiction and I am duty-bound to fulfill their request. Though that may be true, the manner in which I satisfy these demands is up to my discretion." #NT!
 philantrianist.0012.middle.compassionate: "\n\nI can only hope that the locals of [fundraising_county.GetNameNoTier] will cooperate enough so as to not force my hand into doing something I would much rather avoid. The alms have not exactly been entirely voluntary for as long as anyone can remember, and some of my brothers and sisters have been... overzealous in their duties. Understandably, our subjects resent this state of affairs, but if I am willing to be reasonable towards them and only take what they truly don't need, I am sure that they would happily extend the same courtesy." #NT!
 philantrianist.0012.middle.neutral: "\n\nThe locals often try to weasel out of giving their dues, but in such cases I am empowered with a wide variety of options to extract what is rightfully ours, as the residents of [fundraising_county.GetNameNoTier] are likely to discover. Not willing to part with excess wealth is not a good reason enough to refuse supporting the most needy, and the avaricious will be humbled and punished, if need be.\n\nSometimes, the particularly greedy have been known to try and attack us — with insults, punches, or even with swords — but the kind of scum that is willing to lay hands on a respected [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetHolyOrderBrotherOrSister')] of the most wretchedly destitute and selfless of the orders is one that I am encouraged to cut down." #NT!
 philantrianist.0012.middle.sadistic: "\n\nThe pathetic heathen swine that dwell within this accursed land are often resistant to our calls for alms, but naturally, we have devised ways of convincing them they are in error. Truth be told, the cooperative ones cause me great disappointment - either way, we will get our dues, but there is no harm in having a little fun when undertaking this task. After all, we are their betters, and is it not our right to do as we please with them?\n\nWhether I mutilate them, dismember them, butcher them like the pigs they are, it's all for the destitute and the good saint Philantros, bless his name, and therefore none can call me unrighteous. If the paynims of [fundraising_county.GetNameNoTier] refuse us our dues, then they'll rue the day they spurred the indigent." #NT!

 philantrianist.0013.desc.success: "At last, [clique_member_scope.GetFirstName] emerges from the town, spoils in hand. The group encountered no trouble and is most thankful for the opportunity to collect alms from 'such a generous people'. So thankful, in fact, that [clique_member_scope.GetSheHe] offers me a portion of the proceeds as a token of the order's gratitutude!\n\nOf course, the townspeople themself are... unlikely to have appreciated a visit by the Collectors. However, for the near future at least, they're likely to be more preoccupied with worries of how to put food on their tables than anything else." #NT!
 philantrianist.0013.desc.failure: "[clique_member_scope.GetFirstName] and [clique_member_scope.GetHerHis] companions emerge from the town faster than expected, though as they approach it becomes increasingly obvious that they are, in fact, running away. As [clique_member_scope.GetFirstName] catches [clique_member_scope.GetHerHis] breath, [clique_member_scope.GetSheHe] begins to curse the 'blood-curdling avarice' of the locals, and vows to never set foot in the wretched village again.\n\nMy attempts to convince the Philantrosianites to stay falls on deaf ears - the town is, according to them, too corrupted by greed and hatred of the destitute like themselves. They mutter something about some of the other orders being more useful here and gallop away." #NT!

 philantrianist.0021.desc: "Our honest ways and selfless fight to better the station of the destitute has been known to thaw the hearts of even the most stern of rulers. Sometimes we must bend the truth and hide who we actually are for fear of the greedy oppressors' reprisal, true, but was it not Saint Philantros himself who said that the beggar stealing a loaf of bread was more honest than the authorities that oppressed him?\n\nI believe that [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] might be receptive to our pleas for alms – though they might not even realize they are helping the poor until we depart with their donation. If I could spin a sufficiently convincing tale to get [recipient.GetHerHim] to part with [recipient.GetHerHis] gold, the impoverished everywhere will cry out in joy and [recipient.GetFirstName]'s heart will be unburdened from avarice." #NT!

 philantrianist.0022.desc: "Late into the night me and my compatriots plot and scheme, looking for opportunities to make our plan more fool-proof and, perhaps, ambitious. Hushed whispers are exchanged, letters from shady associates in our quarry's court are read under the pale candlelight, and our conspiracy is weaved like a spider's web.\n\nI may give the command to put the plan into motion at any time, though I should probably not be hasty. However, a more elaborate scheme might end up being more risky due to a higher likelihood of any of its part turning in an unexpected direction, so I should beware." #NT!
