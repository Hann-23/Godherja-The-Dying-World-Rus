 anaanide.0001.t: "The Steps of Purification" #NT!
 anaanide.0001.desc: "The road to Anaan begins with a single step to purity.\n\nI entered my chambers, accompanied only by two attendants who started preparing the materials needed for the ritual. Incense was lit, cushions were laid out, and the holy texts were placed before me for easy perusal. The step of purification involves secluding one's self and cleansing one's mind and spirit through a long process of meditation and prayer, a process that may take hours or even days, depending on the worshipper's fortitude and determination.\n\nAs my attendants leave me in solitude, I am reminded of the fact that only the Great Judge knows when I shall finish this step. I mentally steel myself for the long ordeal ahead, and yet, my apprehension remains." #NT!

 anaanide.0002.t: "The Final Step" #NT!
 anaanide.0002.desc: "For an Anaanide to reach the final step is exceedingly rare, and as such, is an occasion accompanied by much revelry. The surrounding towns have been feasting for the past few days, and the air is full of songs and praises to the Great Judge, with Anaanide devotees from distant lands even traveling to join the festivities. I took no part in the celebrations however, spending the night before in prayer to ensure that my soul is completely pure as I take the final step.\n\nFinally, as the sun rose to its full height, I emerged from the temple where I had been meditating and marched to the ritual site accompanied by an entourage of guides, friends, and family. Excitement runs through the air as onlookers observed my march, punctuated by shouts of joy and snippets of prayers.\n\nA thousand paces from the raised platform where I am to undertake the final step, I knelt in prayer, beginning the ritual. Still kneeling, I walked toward the platform while chanting prayers of gratitude to the gods for allowing me to reach this moment. Around me, my companions join me in my chanting to the accompaniment of drums and lyres. Eventually, I reached the center of the platform, which was surrounded by several pyres prepared the day before.\n\nAs I finished my last prayer to the Great Judge, the surrounding pyres erupted in flames of red, green, and gold. I watched as the flames spun and rose, eventually joining into a multicolored pillar of flame. Beyond the inferno, I hear the chants rising into a crescendo as the flames converge upon me in a kaleidoscope of heat and color." #NT!

 anaanide_purification.1003.desc: "Your decision to seclude yourself to take the next step of purification reeks of carelessness, and someone must take you to task for it.

 anaanide_purification.1006.desc: "With my penchant for secluding myself in meditation, I have apparently developed quite a reputation.

 anaanide_purification.1007.desc: "The recent session of meditation and prayer has taken much longer than usual to finish. Hours upon hours was spent kneeling on the cold floor of my sanctum as I struggled to perfectly recite the prayers, and like any good Anaanide, I have abstained from partaking in any food all the while.\n\nWhile my soul is fulfilled after the step's completion, the toll on my body cannot be ignored." #NT!
