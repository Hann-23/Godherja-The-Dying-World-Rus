Fear of the [fog|E], of the broken remains of [aervalr|E], and of the chaos, warfare and suffering that our ancestors have brought. Though many could be blamed for the calamity, one above all can be named the greatest perpetrator, a man now at my mercy.\n\nAfter cutting down the last of his pet fanatics, [prisoner_a.GetFirstName] now awaits his fate in my deepest dungeon. To say that there's little remorse in the old [magi|E]'s rantings and ravings would be an understatement, for he dares to gloat of his reputation as the fool that left the world a burning ruin.\n\nNo matter. On this day, the whims of this vile tyrant will finally cease to matter, once and for all." #NT!
