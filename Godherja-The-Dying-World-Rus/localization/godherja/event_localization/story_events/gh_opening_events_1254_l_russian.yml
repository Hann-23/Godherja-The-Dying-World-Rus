A first battle at 11, a first kill not long after, and a blood soaked path from my homelands in the far east to the warmer weathers of the coast. Bodies the whole way. My life has been war, and it has brought me here. A final stand.\n\nThe [marchers|E] and the Sjalvolki have left me scarred, have left my people scattered, but for the final battle they gather. My men for their part declare me the worldly representation of the Purest, for despite my lack of [magical|E] ability, the First Men themselves heralded me from my cradle to my command post. The Purest himself crowned me with shaking hands. I am the Black Sun. The Aautokratir of the north, and if I am to die, then they shall know my name before I do." #NT!

My glorious realm, such a beautiful and intoxicating hegemony ripped shred from bloody shred by a bunch of infantile non-humans and whatever pitiful excuse of a creature you can even call a Sjalvolki!\n\nIt was Ulfirx, that little bastard, my spies told me so. The young madman, the foolish warlord. Oh he must think himself so genius, so smart, so wise to think he could possibly outsmart me! My spies claimed that he was nothing but a boy, a foolish young idiot, and I had them promptly hung for their foolish insult to me. No mere boy, no idiot, could ever have done this. No, I knows the truth. Ulfirx planned this from the start, for years, for decades even!

I will not allow it, I WILL bring forth vengeance. Ulfirx will feel true pain as I slice off every single little nub on this grizzled bastard's body! He will not understand the pain I will put upon him! He must be thinking of me right now, doubtlessly he has constantly, priding himself for destroying the ONLY TRUE HIGH KING OF THE ISLES AND ALL OF AVERSARIA'S SEAS, and wondering what he could possibly do next. Well he shall soon know what he should do next, DIE! DIE. DIE. If only he knew, if only he knew what he had stumbled upon, what enemy he had made. I declared a blood debt, an anathema upon his entire house, and I shall take it! Entire leagues of scholars have looked upon my family history and wept as they realized that my blood is so pure, so refined by only the greatest champions, that my ancestors of note were beyond number and count! Legions have heard of my realm and thrown down their arms and taken up plows just at the thought of possibly some day having to face me! All of the [magi|E] of [aversaria|E] have sat in shocked silence, afeared of the mighty power trembling from the Isles! I will make Ulfirx feel pain, I will make them all feel pain.

He found a land in turmoil, and his heart was torn as he saw the blood his own people spilt on one another.

When I was born to one of his legionaries and an eastern whore, all would have expected me to have been left on the march or to have been relegated to the train, but Valerix saw not one's race or station, only promise.\n\nValerix is now dead, assassinated no doubt by the Aversarian nobility who were sick of his attempts at ending their cruelty. But they made a mistake, they did not kill his protégé. The men are behind me now, the eastern legion, those thought left behind. Today I will go to my men, I will swear to them on my blood to not rest, to not sleep, until Valerix is avenged and his work finished.\n\nAversaria is dead, but through fire and fury I will reforge it.

Instead of gazing backwards, I have continued to watch the front of our great coalition, following the great Cenware in his march into this dead empire. I was there at Elysia, I stood by his side, and watched as the remnants of this land's old masters were swept aside.\n\nAs reward for my service, I was granted temporary stewardship of the lands taken after the battle. Now, with the remnants of those the Sjalvolki name Red [magi|E] backed into a corner, it is surely only a matter of time before this assingment shall be transformed into permanent rule, if not here, than elsewhere in this land of lush fields. For the future lies not with the children of the Earthshaker, obsessed with their petty feuds. The way forward for my people, for all people, is the world which Cenware is creating." #NT!

I was still a girl when it formed, struck with wonder as I spoke to our people's new traveling companions, the righteous Gethians and wild-haired Salacad warriors. They spoke of their homes, of the steppes and hills beyond our great wood, and beyond even them, Great Kathun, an empire they scorned and mocked as we did [aversaria|E]. A place of treasures and sights past imagining, that perhaps no Sjalvolki had ever laid eyes upon.\n\nWhen Cormag Fenrus broke from the Imperrech and declared we were to travel east, I was among his most eager followers. I earned my name when one of our ships was attacked by a tentacled beast of the depths. I leapt from the bow, and like a crazed animal, I sank my teeth into the kraken. Though it was our harpoons that eventually felled it, my mad bravery and miraculous survival earned me a smile from the Old Dog himself.\n\nWhen we finally landed in [GetTitleByKey('c_asiupoli').GetNameNoTier], I knew my journey was unfinished. As most of the Fenvir prepared to make it our people's home and to stand against the Witch-Breaker should his host ever intrude upon their spoils, I rallied those with wanderlust still in their hearts, and with the Old Dog's blessing we took sail once more. In our battered fleet, we sailed ever further, discovering lands and wonders I could have scarcely dreamed, 'till we landed here, further than any other Sjalvolki has voyaged. Still, I know my travels are not yet done. There are riches and glory to be found in Kashirya, but I still recall the stories I heard as a girl.

The Ölteni, hearing of my patron's demise, came thundering into my domain, while Aterispol burst into riots against my rule.

And then I left the city, thinking it a temporary retreat, after which I would reclaim the city as our people had once reclaimed the Empire.\n\nInstead, I have simply waited, keeping my grip upon my little ember of Aversaria, raising high the banners of an Aautokratir long dead.
