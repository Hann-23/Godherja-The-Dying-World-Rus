 artifacts_flavor.1000.t: "That Cursed Automata" #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1000.desc: "Another late night in my study comes to an end and I groggily begin the short walk to my chambers. As I round the corner and enter the final stretch to reach my bedchambers my gaze is caught by the barest hint of a menacing humanoid form - there in the shadows cloaking the corridor - a flash of yellow-white teeth, a murderous grin drawn right out of my nightmares. I stumble backwards, blood frozen cold in my veins, a cry of panic catching in my throat and emerging only as a phlegmy cough. It takes a moment before my senses return to me and the pale moonlight clarifies the scene. That awful phantom resolves into the all too familiar form of the farcical little Kartharaddi automata crouching in its standby position, its maniac grin staring sightlessly past me. I curse under my breath realizing that the servants must have accidentally left this horrid little imp here when were cleaning and oiling it today." #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1001.t: "Deciphering Mas'en Malik's Enigma" #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1001.desc: "It's near midnight, and myself and a small team of scribes and magi have been poring over my copy of the Field of Pearls for the better part of the day already. I can feel that we are close to a breakthrough as individual ciphers and codes begin to converge upon one another pointing towards a single grand mystery. Maybe some secret to the flow of [aervalr|E]'s cycles, or perhaps some mystic pattern to the soundless heartbeat of the world, unknown and unheard to all but the most perceptive of [dead_magi|E].\n\nOr perhaps it is something darker, more terrible than any of these. One of the terrible secrets that haunt the peripheries of the art of [dead_magic|E]. Such has one of my advisors, with eyes hinting at an unspoken terror, intimated to me.\n\nMas'en Malik... who was your benefactor really?" #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1002.t: "The Enigma Conquered!" #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1002.desc: "I am taking a break from our endeavor in my private chambers when a rapid and heavy knocking comes at my door no more than five minutes into a fruitless attempt to nap. My first instinct is annoyance, but upon taking one look at the stunned and excited expression on the young messenger's face I feel my heart leap into my throat. He barely manages to let slip the word "breakthrough" before I'm pushing past him and running to my laboratory. The [magi|E] I put in charge of the operation looks as surprised as everyone else and they clearly struggle to maintain their composure. "We realized we were approaching the [ROOT.Char.Custom('fieldsofpearlciphername')] all wrong, and the moment we changed our method everything just fell into place." they stammer, and point at the heavily marked copies of the pages in question. "It's everything we imagined and more."" #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1002.a.exceptionalsuccess: "You decode significant ritual knowledge." #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1003.t: "The Enigma Deciphered!" #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1003.desc: "After several long weeks of work my team and I have finished our endeavors. Many valuable secrets and rituals have been painstakingly pulled from Mas'en Malik's prose, at great cost in sweat, blood, and reagents. It is certain the book holds even greater secrets, but for now we shall have to rest on our laurels." #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1004.t: "A Frustrating Conclusion." #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1004.desc: "The secrets of the Pearls have clearly eluded us. Though we tried our best, the ritual we conduct fails to do anything at all. Everyone involved is frustrated, angry, and on the verge of snapping. All of our efforts, wasted." #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1004.a: "So many sleepless nights..." #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1004.a.failure: "You fail to decode any rituals." #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1005.t: "Naught but Ashes!" #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1005.desc: "Perhaps one of the most dangerous aspects of Mas'en Malik's magnum opus are the litany of deadly "trap" rituals that have been written into the work, apparent tests to weed out the unworthy. All of these are accompanied by explicit warnings as to their true nature, but these are written in their own sequences of coded phrases often yet more esoteric and difficult than the suicidal spells they accompany. We knew the risks, and we took every precaution, deciphering far more of the text than we needed so that we might suss out some hint of deception.\n\nIt was not enough.\n\nThe screams of the [magi|E] I assigned to take the lead and their assistants are the first indication that something has gone terribly wrong. I watch in horror as one young man breaks off from scribing a rune on the floor to begin writhing in agony. His panicked cries dwindle first into hoarse rasps, then into stony silence as I am witness to his face disintegrating into an oily, ash-like substance. Glancing around in panic, I can see the baleful effect rapidly spreading through the other participants as the ritual descends into chaos. It may be too late for the others, but if I act quickly in raising a ward I may just be able to save myself. Out of the corner of my eye I can see my [court_magi|E] attempting to do the same." #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1007.t: "A Cryptic Endeavor" #NT!
 artifacts_flavor.1007.desc: "My liege has recently approached me informing me of their intentions to begin the heady work of decoding Mas'en Malik's Fields of Pearls and Mine of Gems, a labyrinthine book series containing history, poetry, cooking recipes, and jokes both held as the pinnacle of Ritualist culture in Sarradon as well as believed to hold over a thousand rituals, spells, and other arcane truths in the form of intricate codes so devilishly devised that they do nothing to tarnish the work's genuine value as a literary work. Assisting would certainly allow me to glean valuable insights from the endeavor, though it would come at great cost. My liege would likely not appreciate me turning down their request." #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1008.desc: "The wind rises above us as I blow the ebony horn and bellow across the night sky. I notice pale tendrils of whispy mist begin to snake across the ground before our small ritual circle, forming into ghastly apparitions. They appear in armors both familiar and exotic, weapons at the ready, marching in our direction. My companions either scream and run in fear, or freeze as the apparitions pass harmlessly past them. Towards me.\n\nBefore long, a great host has formed around me, ready for war.

 artifacts_flavor.1008.desc_craven: "The wind rises above us as my servant shakily blows the ebony horn, bellowing across the night sky. My heart nearly jumps from my chest as pale tendrils of whispy mist begin to snake across the ground before our small ritual circle. Suddenly ghastly apparitions begin to form from the mist dressed for war, marching in our direction. My companions either scream and run in fear or freeze in place as the apparitions pass harmlessly past them. I try to run as well but it takes seconds before I'm completely surrounded by the spirits. I know this is for the sake of [black_horn_user.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTooltip], but I hope I can still find some way to escape with my life." #NT!

I hardly have a chance to move before they are upon me, the Spirits of the Horn, cutting off any possibility of escape. The spirits raise their ghostly blades in unison as a silent chant emanates from their mouths.\n\nThe throng of spirits moves around me, pushing me forward with them towards battle. I have but a moment to take one last fleeting glance at my home before it fades into a haze of mist behind me." #NT!

 artifacts_flavor.1010.desc: "For five years I have managed to live. Five years of escape from Death itself.\n\nBut no longer.\n\nThe air had chilled around my heir and I before we had noticed their approach, the Spirits of the Horn. Tendrils of mist bloom around us as the spirits take form and grab me by the throat. [heir.GetNameNoTooltip] tries to scream but it's quickly stifled as they're yanked into the mist by the spirits. A discomforting chant echos amongst the figures in a language I do not recognize, as three of them take hold of my head and begin to pull. Seconds of pure agony pass before my neck rips apart. In my last moment, I can feel the apparitions reach into my being, and drag out my spirit once and for all." #NT!
