 bonecrafting.0120.desc: "Exploring this ancient battlefield is proving to be underwhelming to an extent I did not think was possible beforehand. Not only are there very few [magi|E] on this battlefield to begin with, but those present were evidently incompetent at the art. The great majority of these Magi seem to have killed themselves attempting to cast spells beyond their strength, which does not bode well for the merit of their bones. Additionally, it is extraordinarily difficult to find intact skeletons, as many of them have been reduced to dust or tiny fragments by time or the manner of their death. I am tempted to call this expedition off and return home, but I think better of it and decide to at least fetch the more usable fragments." #NT!

 bonecrafting.0121.desc: "As I begin to inspect what seems to be a major battle from ages past, I am filled with a morbid sort of excitement when I find the first skeleton of an ancient [magi|E]. It's hard work, but for the rest of the day I and several of my most physically able servants labor to excavate the site and manage to find a few skeletons that clearly belonged to magi. Though these bones aren't the cream of the crop, these Magi were certainly quite fearsome in their day, and I lament for a moment that they never received burials befitting their stature. The feeling is fleeting however, and soon enough we've dug up nearly all of the at least passable bones in the area. A good day's work, but how many shall we leave here and how many shall we carry back?" #NT!
 bonecrafting.0121.a: "Let us take a relatively passable assortment of bones and leave the rest to rot here" #NT!

This place was host to a cataclysmic battle long, long ago that resulted in the deaths of countless warriors and [magi|E]. It is sure to be a veritable treasure trove for an enterprising practitioner such as I. Fortunately for us, the remains of fallen magi are strewn about the entire battlefield, making it rather effortless for us to begin gathering our prizes. All in all, we are left with the bones of many astoundingly powerful Magi, amazingly relatively unscathed despite the timescales involved. The hardest portion of this expedition will be choosing which ones to take." #NT!
 bonecrafting.0122.a: "This was quite the fruitful adventure, we'll be taking the best of the bones out here." #NT!

Though some of the residents of the area mumble harsh words under their breath, we press on regardless. Be that as it may, we quickly manage to pry the magi from their place of rest and begin examining our find. Upon closer appraisal of the bones, it seems that this one was likely a mere village [magi|E], who probably sold minor concoctions to peasants. The [magical|E] impotency of the remains is quite disheartening, and I question if I have wasted my time in coming here. Nonetheless, even the weakest of material can be made use of in a pinch." #NT!

 bonecrafting.0131.desc: "After weeks of research, planning and careful surveying of the chosen grave, I've finally made my way over to what is said to be the final resting place of a former [magi|E], reputed for his skills in the arcane. The tomb itself is somewhat fortified with wards, likely in anticipation of grave robbers. Unfortunately for them, I came prepared for this, and I hastily draw a ritual circle before performing a quick counterspell to dispel the wards keeping me from my goal. The body is clothed in the robes of a Magi and clearly filled with power, as it radiates a faint amount of energy even in death. These bones will surely provide ample fuel for my magical endeavours." #NT!
 bonecrafting.0131.a: "This Magi was quite good, and their remains will do me much good in future rituals." #NT!

 bonecrafting.0132.desc: "For months, I have obsessed over the whereabouts of a legendary crypt, rumored to harbour the bones of a [magi|E] now remembered only in fables for their vast power when they still dwelt within the realm of the living. Though it frustrated me to no end, I have recently made a breakthrough and have set off to what I believe to be the vicinity of the crypt. At first, it almost appears as if I was incorrect in my estimations, but then I suddenly see my own face reflecting off of the air itself. I swiftly dismiss the glamour with a simple spell and at last set foot in the crypt.\n\nThe moment I step inside the crypt I can feel the [magic|E] within flow around me, and it's quickly apparent that whatever lies in here was remarkably powerful in the past. My entire body quivers at its touch, and I am soon face to face with the skeletal remains that lay inside. It's magnificent, and it will serve me well." #NT!

A few days after the conclusion of our pact, we meet once again in a secluded area, and I tell the trader to show me his wares. To say I was outraged would be an understatement, as the accursed swindler opened a box full of mundane bones! My rage momentarily subsided as I saw that there were indeed some magical bones contained within, obscured by the others they were mixed in with. Alas, they were of poor quality at best, but nevertheless I start haggling with the merchant. " #NT!

After waiting a few weeks, I go to the designated rendezvous to purchase these unconventional commodities from my chosen vendor under cover of darkness. They show me the bones they've brought for sale, and it seems that these are indeed filled with [magic|E]. I tell the merchant which of them I'm interested in buying, and we commence negotiations.

Their own agents broker a deal with mine to arrange a meeting with me and this smuggler at the determined time and place. As the day of the appointment finally arrives I finally go to meet this mysterious smuggler. Upon actually meeting them, I find myself underwhelmed by his relatively unassuming appearance, though it does seem like they've brought the merchandise. It is clear that this one is no fraud, as I feel the power emanating from them as the smuggler opens their container. I examine the bones more closely and am quite pleased by their excellent quality and promptly start bargaining over the terms of the sale." #NT!

Bonemolding is the art of creating various types of [magical|E] artifacts using the remains of beings who once wielded arcane power in life. It is conventionally taught at an early age, as its employment of several basics of magic in tandem helps to reinforce fundamental concepts in budding Magi.
