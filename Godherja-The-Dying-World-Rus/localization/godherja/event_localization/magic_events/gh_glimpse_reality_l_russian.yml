 glimpse_reality.0001.desc: "As the ritual circle glows with that all too familiar uncanny blue light, my all too limited vessel grows slack beneath me while my mind begins to take flight to that transcendental realm once more. Ethereal wings bear me through the never ending well of power rising up like a pillar of flame from the tremendous abyss beneath me. Though the light of my own mortal eyes has grown increasingly dim through incessant use of the gift, here nothing can elude the power of my gaze.\n\nMore arcane energies flow into the ritual, revealing thin strands of light that I need only reach out and grasp. I glide through the endless domain and am steadily pulled towards more vibrant threads that glow like stars in the darkness. I reach out with formless, disembodied hands and survey what strand to grasp..." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.0010.desc: "I open my eyes, to the dance of the fireflies, their intricate movements leading the way to a verdant forest. Instead of boots or feet, I find myself walking on cloven hooves, my head weighed down by a crown of antlers. In the distance glistens a moonlit pool, the near silver water beckoning me closer, until my lips finally reach its cold surface. It is then, I hear the crack of a branch and the flight of birds, my head turning to spot a shrouded figure with it's bow drawn. The arrow penetrating my hide and sending me crashing to the floor. I can only wait as the hunter approaches, walking around until they are crouched right in front of me and pulling back their hood. My own eyes, staring back at me. " #NT!

 glimpse_reality.0501.desc: "Rapturous cheers drown out my thoughts, and I have scarcely a moment to see the huge column being toppled, shattering on the ground with a force that sends out tremors. The surrounding plaza is bustling with armed men in tribal garb, though apart from a few that are carrying valuables and some billows of smoke on the horizon, they do not seem to be actively looting. Most are uproariously cheering, while some taunt the people peering through the windows and balconies - who seem to be in a decisively less celebratory mood.\n\nI notice what is likely to be the leader of this army - a man of impressive build and a contemplative look, surrounded by retainers scarcely less formidable in appearance. A group of nobles and a king clad in a distinctly different style of clothing approach, corralled by a group of soldiers, though the vision ends just before they reach the tribal overlord." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.0502.desc: "The thread unravels, and I find myself within a candle-lit tent, with what appears to be a war council deliberating over a map late into the night. The figures are either shrouded or have faces that I do not recognize, but I can understand their animated discussion - they are discussing the tactics that they intend to employ in an upcoming battle.\n\nI nearly disbelieve my own ears when I catch one of the men mentioning my own name.\n\nApparently, whoever these people are, the enemy that they will be facing tomorrow is none other than myself. Though this battle may be years away, or it might never even come to fruition, it is a rare fortune to be able to know a foe's clever plans this far in advance. I will take careful note of everything I overhear." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.0503.tooltip: "Within the strand I see great martial feats" #NT!
 glimpse_reality.0503.desc: "The thread unravels, manifesting me onto a battlefield. A group of knights stand their ground against a horde of screaming bearded warriors, but they are clearly outnumbered. Their less-armored compatriots have broken and abandoned the mercenaries to their fate. A dense [fog|E] swiftly rolls in, concealing a berserker as he swings his axe and knocks a squire off their horse. In an instant, the other knights close ranks and manage to drag the young squire behind their lines as the berserker is run through with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe wind whips and swirls, forming a massive undulating column of mist. A massive paw the size of a tree trunk rips out of the column, out of which appears a giant bear, eyeless, scales running down its body in stripes that ripple and gleam in the morning sun. It stands on its hind legs like a man, swinging a giant claw towards the knights. Those who are not fast enough are instantly crushed. Shaken, the remaining soldiers still move to surround the bear. It is their final stand.\n\nThen, a horn sounds! Knights on horseback pour through the broken line and charge the [fogbeast|E]. Their leader's helm is blood-red, his sword arm outstretched, and he cuts off the bear's leg with one, powerful strike. The beast's roar sounds like the screams of a thousand men as it topples over, narrowly missing the squire in the process. The red knight stops and extends a hand to the man on the ground.\n\n"Up! Up, you bastard!" The knight looks about in a rage, "The craven [magi|E] have abandoned us to the wolves! They are devoid of honor! Unburnished by glory! They expect us to sacrifice our lives for the sake of their dying empire. I spit on their coin and their damned emperor! Come!" He turns his horse around while pointing, "We ride for the coast!"\n\nThe vision starts to fade, but on the other side of the battlefield, I see the silhouette of a powerful man on a horse. He looks serenely at the retreating knights while cleaning his sword. The last scene I see is him raising his hand up in a salute." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.1001.desc: "The vision takes me to the sitting room of a lavishly decorated mansion, with several well-dressed men and women exchanging banter over half-finished drinks, some clearly more than a bit tipsy. Luckily for me, they are conversing in [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip], and judging by their interests, they appear to be merchants of various kinds.\n\nThe topics of their conversation are not exactly the most riveting - the prices of various goods, lucrative trade routes, and recent political events of minor import. They do discuss various strategies they intend to employ in their future dealings, as well as insider information that most would not be privy to. Perhaps I could use some of this to my own ends." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.1002.desc: "The howling of wind rapidly rises, and I find myself in a sandstorm. Attempting to get my bearings, I soon run into what appears to be the foot of a cliff - but upon closer inspection, this turns out to be no cliff. In front of me stands a colossal sandstone structure. Though crumbling and long since stripped of anything remotely valuable, it still manages to impress with its sheer size.\n\nLooking around, I realize that this is only one of many. Around me, an entire dead metropolis eternally slumbers. Palaces, monuments, dry canals - all devoured by the sandy maw of the surrounding desert. This place once knew glory and life, but now it is nothing more than a colossal tomb. I eventually lose my bearings in the sandstorm, and the vision is soon over." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.1501.desc: "The strand turns into a shadow which rapidly spreads to engulf me. Around me, I hear whispers, though what they are saying is impossible to discern. I am then taken on a series of visions of affairs not meant for the light of day - a vassal and their councillor talking in a hushed tone about their liege. A clandestine meeting between two people of interest I had never realized knew each other. A servant eavesdropping on their master. A letter that could cause disaster if it falls into the wrong — or right — hands.\n\nEach of these visions is too short, fragmented and dreamlike to give information that may be of immediate use, but my eyes are ever so slightly more open to the goings-on of the realm that lies behind the curtain of public life and knowledge." #NT!

 glimpse_reality.3002.desc: "I can smell the distinct smell of pines, morning dew and strangely enough - embers, despite there being no signs of a fire nearby. I stand in a forest, the Sun rising, [aervalr|E] low on the horizon and surrounded by a cloud of debris and shards the size of which I had never seen before.\n\nNearby, a tattoed man stands. Dressed in tribal garb, he appears to be no more than a simple shepherd, his flock visible in the distance. As he makes his way up an incline, I follow, and we soon reach the peak. Our expressions turn to abject terror as we see the sight beyond - a majestic vista being consumed by a soupy, malicious [fog|E] reaching to the height of clouds, approaching with the speed and ferocity of a tidal wave.\n\nThe shepherd drops to his knees in shock, and begins to sob and feverishly pray in a language that I do not understand. As the [fog|E]'s rumbling approach reaches a crescendo, so does the man's prayer, and I am nearly overpowered by the intensity of emotion radiating off of him. Finally, the [fog|E] hits us, and I am violently jerked back into reality." #NT!

Getting closer, I see cracks have formed, revealing that the sandstone has covered the original black bricks. I sense the magical mechanisms creaking and groaning after centuries of unuse. Then, a piercing shriek sounds directly in my ears and I am transported into a dark, forgotten room.\n\n"You are close..." A shadow speaks, reverberating in my own tongue. It is ancient, I know it, and it has been waiting for me, me and me alone.Somehow, I find the words. "Your power... it is great, indeed, if you can sense me."\n\n"It is yours. Find the towers.

Perhaps on the morrow we shall talk of what price they will have to pay to achieve this. Or mayhaps I shall see their nefarious activities become known to all? Of course, the choice is mine, all mine, and it will ever remain so. My soul coalesces into a much more dense haze before I allow myself to be pulled back by my bereft soma." #NT!

I stand in a dimly-lit [assassin.Custom('GetShadyLocation')], the light of a nearby torch casting ominous shadows over what is clearly a fresh corpse.\n\nWhile I cannot know the identity of this wretched soul, I can certainly deduce who is responsible for their demise - a [assassin.GetWomanMan] dressed in black garb cleans [assassin.GetHerHis] blade as [assassin.GetSheHe] makes [assassin.GetHerHis] exit from the scene, slinking away into the safety of the night. [assassin.GetSheHe|U] cannot hide from me, however - I have seen [assassin.GetHerHis] face, and have seen [assassin.GetHerHis] course of action for the next few days, and the exact location of [assassin.GetHerHis] hideout.

Below me, a commander heroically leads an effort to rally their warriors while the battle turns against [commander.GetHerHim], while yet another commander beats a retreat, dooming the ill-fated effort. The world twists and turns around me as another scene appears before me, that same heroic commander blamed for the ensuing terrible defeat by their duplicitous comrade and banished for it.

The agony drives my mind to flight, but there is no escape, no blissful retreat from this vision of misery. I look to the side, and what I see makes me sob tears of blood, a great and glorious dragon twisted into an unnatural shape in a mockery of life.\n\nDenial courses through me, and I futilely attempt to dismiss this vision as a nightmare that is all too real. The compassionate beast reaches for me with one broken, mangled hand as a wave of horrible power causes its head to burst into flames. A sound of terror, grief, sadness and fright and horror emerges from my throat as my mind forces its way out of the vision, and as I flee, the very fog itself weeps.

An army of dead soldiers march forward in an endless procession, covered in gaping wounds and staring listlessly with lidless eyes. Once proud armor, now covered with the stains of blood and mud. They point their blades to the sky as an uncontrollable welch of fear and dread encompasses me. A man hovers above us, thrashing wildly, impaled by an innumerable number of blades with a garish crown nailed to his head. He eyes are bloody, full of anguish and pain. I look down at my cold, pale hands, realizing we hold the blades that force him ever onward. I am him and he is me, trapped in a body that can never die, damned to march endlessly. A pitiful, painful, useless existence. I try to scream, but no voice can come out. Suddenly, my soul is ripped back into the world of the living. I lay in bed for [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] knows how long, unable to move as my mind churns incessantly. When I finally gain control, my body no longer feels like my own. My soul is trapped in this body, and only death will set it free." #NT!
