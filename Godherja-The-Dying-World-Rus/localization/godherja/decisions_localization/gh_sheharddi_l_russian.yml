 reclaim_eloi_decision_desc: "Just as the Kathaba'al, the Fount of Wisdom, the Word of Eloi, ruled our people in the Land That Was Promised with righteousness, so too do I rule our people. Though never again shall we return to those sacred gardens and enjoy paradise, we have built our second kingdom here in this land of deserts and cedars and rebuked the heathens who had kept us in bondage. Just as Kathaba'al, King of Kings, drove out sin from his kingdom, so too shall I drive out sin from mine. I have done as no other faithful has, and already my people say that I am the Kathaba'al come again to deliver them from evil." #NT!
