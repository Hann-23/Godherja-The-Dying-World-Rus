The scrolls in question documented visions witnessed with the aid of the "Skull of the Purest", an enigmatic artifact of unknown origin, fate or even confirmed existence.\n\nThe visions themselves are often barely coherent, their subject most often (where there is a discernable subject at all) acts of extreme cruelty and boundless depravity committed by a race identified by Vias as the 'First Men' of Aagiokratan myth. Interspersed throughout the book are also commentaries and analyses of the unknown 9th century author of the compendum, most often from a theological standpoint.\n\nRegardless of the visions' veracity, there is a profoundly unsettling quality to the text, and some of the more sinister chapters are considered difficult to even read entirely. At multiple points, the 9th century compiler alludes to the existence of more scrolls by Vias Valon, but these were not included in the tome for reasons unknown." #NT!

Centuries of rule by the Aestraex dynasty were brought to an end in 421 BI when the city's last monarch, the vicious, insane and likely cannibalistic Dioxa'nex the Younger was toppled in a bloody coup that saw his entire line perish. After being unable to decide upon a successor, the citizenry instead decided to pick a ruler from their ranks by gathering up all magi and having each cast their vote upon who should take the throne. Thus was elected Eliaxa'cea, a great reformer and the first to bear the title of Arkonir.\n\nAfter a successful 17 year reign, rather than passing the throne to her eldest child as would be the norm, she decided to instead recall the magi of the city to yet again pick a successor - and thus a 400 year long tradition was born." #NT!

The primary enemy general, Naramaššin ad Hadur, breaker of Naucipax, burner of Orasbael, and butcher of Artexis, is especially smeared into near absurdity.

Second, that Naramaššin's invasion was completely unjustified, as disproven by the countless records of Orasbaeli, Valthronax, and Tylonic provocations in the years leading up to the conflict. Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle." #NT!

Ultimately, the team was forced to turn back several hundred leagues short of their goal, noting that no tower was visible from their location, and concluding that the source might be buried, or of a fundamentally different nature than the Sea Tower, but certainly inaccessible.\n\nDisturbingly, several members of the expedition went delirious by the time the party turned back, and instead pressed on to their almost certain demise." #NT!

Procopion's main arguments against the existence of the Fog are the unreliability of tribal witnesses, the intristic absurdity of a magical phenomenon not apparently associated with either the Living or Dead schools, the ability to ascribe many of the strange events sighted to more mundane reasons, and Iolianos' alleged Axiaotheaist sympathies. The idea of allowing barbarian tribes to migrate into Aversaria proper is treated with special mockery.\n\nNeedless to say, the work did not age well, and the [GetTitleByKey('e_mayikprolollan').GetNameNoTier] has quietly disowned it and Master Procopion a few decades after its publication." #NT!

Furthermore, it confirms previously unverified reports of tribal humans dwelling within, but remarks that all attempts at communication were met with hostility, and that the single living captive—who was virtually constantly attempting to commit suicide until they succeeded—spoke no language known to scholars or barbarian interpreters. \n\nFinally, it touches upon the rumours of a newly emergent, third school of magic associated with the Fog and used by tribal Magi, but makes no definitive judgement here, claiming that the current evidence is inconclusive at best." #NT!

Of course, this picture is in stark contrast with anything even unbiased scholars would say about the living conditions of the Imperium, leading many to dismiss the book as nothing but a propaganda piece written by Climent to ingratiate himself with his patron.\n\nOf much greater interest to the common reader, however, are the rather fascinating pages that talk about the city itself - an impressive metropole of marble and brass, with clockwork automata seemingly integrated into every facet of life. The credibility of these parts of the book have never been in question, for the Kartharaddi were widely known for their mastery of clockwork machinery.\n\nCuriously, though it would seem that the work originally referenced the name of the city several times, it is actually impossible to read these specific words.

It tells of Lexenir's encounters with no less than 11 different cults, each of which possessed their own strange and violent traditions. These traditions, which range from ritual cannibalism to human sacrifice to drinking the blood of Redrunner settlers, are described in excruciating detail, as is his heroism in saving people from such terrible fates. The people of the Redlands are described in ways that make them sound less than human, claiming that they hide themselves during the day due to the sun's deadly light.\n\nThe book is accompanied by a series of drawings, which Lexanir claims are traditional Redlander art, consisting of complicated patterns of shapes, arranged in complicated patterns that seem to suggest great monsters in their curving, spiraling lines.

On page twelve of over two thousand (though half of them have long been lost and forgotten due to most scholars considering the writing to be 'subpar'), the Lich states that this is because "My glorious words will one day be beautiful holy texts!

He then from his hilt lifted the severed head of a soldier who had dissapeared only a week beforehand. Seeing it as somekind of threat Cromus strucked the man dead where he stood. This was infact a mere gesture of reconciliation, Kardwen often exchange the heads of the fallen so that their spirits may enter the afterlife.

 artifact_sculpture_mask_of_ankepy_ix_description: "The famously decadent and ostentatious Kemsarian king Ankepy IX certainly left behind a burial mask befitting of his title and personality. Not content with mere gold, Ankepy had his mask painstakingly casted from several magically-potent meteorites — a process that required the combined efforts of some of the greatest Sarradonian [magi|E] and metalsmiths of the time. This base was then encrusted with precious gems beyond count, with seemingly every variety that exists on [aeras|E] being present, while the mask's two mortal eyes are made of particularly large and impressive bloodcrystals.\n\nMost noteworthy, however, is the mask's "third eye". Like most Kemsarian sovereigns, Ankepy went to the afterlife accompanied by servants, however their sheer amount and rank — his high officials, consort, concubines, household staff, personal guard, [magi|E] cabal and tens of thousands of slaves - surpasses the excesses of even the vast majority of his predecessors and successors. All of these were ritually slain and their souls interred into a black gemstone of unknown origin that makes up the mask's third eye, so that they may continue to serve their master into eternity." #NT!

 artifact_seal_wardenism_description: "A plain clay seal bearing the image of a key surrounded by text too heavily weathered to make out.

According to legend, after being recovered from the ashen remains of the late king's stronghold, it was immediately offered to the [wardenite|E] messiah — who rebuked the suggestion and instead ordered it sold for the purposes of charity.\n\nAlmost nothing remains of the headpiece's former glory but a corroded, broken skeleton.
