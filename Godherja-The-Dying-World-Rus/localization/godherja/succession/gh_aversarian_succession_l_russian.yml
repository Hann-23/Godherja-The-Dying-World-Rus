 aversarian_succession.0001.desc: "As I know, after an [aversarian|E] ruler dies and an heir is needed, any with magic in their blood are allowed to contest other challengers for the title, to prove they are the purest of blood and therefore the most worthy of the throne. As I am a Doux or higher, and our Purest just died, I can choose to engage in this fight to the death or stay out." #NT!
 aversarian_succession.0001.desc.inelegible: "My predecessor has passed away, and the throne falls into my hands - or at least, that would be the conventional wisdom. However, as per our ancient [aversarian|E] traditions, only those with the finest of arcane skillsets are fit to don the crown, skillsets proven in vicious magical duels to the death.\n\nSadly, either due to a complete lack of magical capability, youth or other factors, I am unable to actually compete in the [blood_senate|E]. Until such a time as a proper successor is chosen, though, I am the custodian of the throne. If no other candidate presents themselves, it passes to me by default, though this is a long shot unless I use... other means to encourage them to drop out." #NT!
